"Baralikadu Tourist place is very popular. This place accessibility is good and I like this place, I come here with my friends in last month. This place is very attractive and good for summer holidays. This place location is good and natural looking is very nice. This place is not any good natural local sightseeing near of this place. This place have long distance with developed area so no any many hotel near of this place and good transport links with other city and places. This place have many transport service for going other places. This place is natural place and spread in long area so security is not proper work in this place and disturb many time but maintenance is not good. This place is good for holidays but not for a long time.",Baralikadu

If you visit MP and Miss chindwara than you have not seen anything. Parineeti Chopra's favourate destination. Main places to see here but Deogarh fort is main attraction. Hotels are easily available here. Safe,Chhindwara
"Its a must see place in andaman trip. Scuba diving, and snoorkelling are main attraction. The Radhanagar beach is wonderfull place to play. clean and safe. The packages only covers this. You have to pay extra for other places like kaalapattar beach, eliphanta beach etc.  Nothing much in Kaalapattar beach you can take some photo. But you must visit eliphanta beach for fun Water games. ( Travelling  costs you rs. 750 per person) Special  Banana is famous fruit dont forget to eat. The agents/people in havelock are roude, rough and money minded  compare to all other part of andaman. If you are pure vegitarian, food is major issue, but if you search you get one or two.  Tour is enjoyable if visitted in group. Hotels are available but book prior of visit. Keep an eye on weather as it is not safe during cyclones. Totally the island is bit costlier than other places nearby.",Havelock Island

The fort is close to pune which is good . It is a good place for trekking. A early morning departure from pune and you might be back till 5 in the evening. The place needs maintenance . It is not fully intact but nine of the fort in india is fully intact. If you choose trekking then its ok but if you decided to ho to the base of fort by car or any vehicle the roads arent good . You can get high amount of traffic,Sinhagad
"Hi friends. Now I'm going to sharing my peaceful experience about kodaikanal. I gone to this hills station more than 3 times. We go to All the summer season. First of all kodaikanal is easily to accessible by bus, car, train. First we are gone to visit the BERIJAM LAKE. The lake was so different, excited with different climate. And then we gone to kodaikanal lake this lake also nice. Silver cascade falls, Bryant park , pillars rocks view point, kumbakkarai falls, chettiyar Park and moir point. The hotel and accommodation are so good. we stayed at GRAND PALACE hotel just 1km in centre of kodaikanal. Nice service, good lighting, room cleaness is good. The accommodation is just 2500rs only we have provided breakfast for all and we services are very good. The safety is better than the other hotels also All the friends and family members are just go and visit to the beautiful city of kodaikanal.",Kodaikanal
"Sinhagad is the best near by tourist place near by Pune it is only 37 km from pune.easly any one can go by bike and it is the best option to reach there. sinhagad is around 2000 years old fort.it has its won history. best time to visit sinhagad is rainy season. I visited this place many time with my friends, family. you can reach up on fort by stares or trek both options are available. in rainy season it is almost covered by fog and it continuously drizzle.with cold wind.in short weather on sinhagad is amazing.romantic, it is situated quite at height  and it is foggy so it feels live you are in clouds it feels awesome. there you can get variety of food.veg and non veg both in veg one special and yummy item is zhunka bhakar with thecha.and in rainy season kanda bhaji with tea while it is drizzling I advice every one should visit this place once in life time.",Sinhagad
"Hai friends I want to share here my experience from the place kodaikanal. Kodaikanal is the very coolest and very relaxing place in thamil Nadu. Everyone day thousands of people are coming there to enjoy the climate there. I went there many times with my family and friends as well. But the main problem is to reach there. It is full of hair pin roads and very difficult for driving. Many accidents had happened there because of the invisibility of the opposite vehicles . There the airport facility is there but from there again have to take the same roads to reach there. Some roads are with full gutters and chances are more for accidents. The local sight seeing good. We can see many of places with natural beauty. Many gardens, suicide point, museum, boating, ropeway etc are there. But there the roads and surroundings are not cleaned and hygiene. People are polluting the roads like anything. The tourists places are not maintaining properly. So for kids this place is not comfortable. The facilities for trashing is not good. The charge for some spot seeing is very costly and not worthful. Many hotels and restaurants are available there. But they are charging by seeing the customers. There is no fixed rate for the food and rooms. So we should have to compare it very well before deciding the hotels and restaurants. There it is very safety place only. The people are  very helpful and coperate. But at the place of boating,  I could not felt any safety measures. So overall I am not happy with this tourist place mainly because of polluted surroundings.",Kodaikanal
"People in Kodaikanal urinate in the public places without having second thoughts. Whether it is near the lake or the main road or the places where people walk around. Government has provided with public toilets, which people should really use. Most of the tourist places are stinking of urine badly. If this is the case how foreign citizens will think about?",Kodaikanal
"Let me tell you what you will get to see here The temple is located near the beach. Although the beach is not that clean. There is a boating facility which I am sure we all enjoy. Infrastructure of the temple is Just Awesome. In the evening the Sunset scenery is out of this world. The hotel facility is decent. In the evening you will always find an atmosphere of festival which is really cool. All in all, the place is really good.",Murdeshwar
I have been to agra in 2016 to see taj mahal with a few friends. I deborded there at 11 in the morning. And took the auto for taj mahal which wasn't far away from there. We went there but the auto driver wasnt nice at all. He was trying to portray an image of agra Wala's that they are richest and coolest. Any way we went to tajmahal but it was not open for general public for that time. So we thought to go around. And fixed a deal with a cab driver to go a little siteseeing. He said he will take us to meena bazar famous market there but took us to a local shop there in a different street there. Again he was traing to make a fool out of us. And such thing kept happening all day. Bottom line is agra people are not kind or generous or even humble. If you go there be aware of your surroundings and do research.,Agra
"I went to kodaikanal around 6 months back with my friends. We were 6 in number and visited in the month of may. We went in bus, first from my place ( kerala) to bangalore and then from bangalore to kodaikanal. When I reached there the weather was cold and since it had rained a day before. We stayed in the nearby cottege. The location of the cottage was so beautiful and felt as if I was living amidst the cloud. Best for sightseeing We booked a cab to roam around the city. We covered vatican falls, guna cave, pillar rock, mannavur lake, dolphin nose, suicide point. We also went for boating in the lake and cycling around the lake. The view from suicide point and walk in the guna cave was excellent. It was a wonderful experience. Next day we went for trekking amongst the beautiful hills. The weather was bit cold, but was a great experience. All the sceneries were super, took a lot of photos and enjoyed our time. The stay at the cottege was good. The food was excellent.",Kodaikanal
"Sinhgad is the fort located in Pune district Haveli taluka. It is the fort in sahyadri mountain having near about 1300 meters above sea level. The fort is built almost 2000 years ago and having its own history. This fort is named as Kondhana before the war of Tanaji Malusare and udaybhan. After that war named is given as SINHGAD by the King Shiwaji. We can reach to the fort by Bus or private vehicle. For train and plain nearest station is Pune. From Pune we can reach at the fort by cab or public transport. If we go from private vehicle we can reach up to the top of mountain. If we go from the public Bus we can reach at the base point. For fort seeing we required at least 2-3 hours. there are two main doors for entering the fort. There are not big hotels at sinhgad but we can get food on stalls at fort. Main food course on the fort is same and popular. The Kanda Bhaji, Zunka bhakar, Curd on the fort is famous. many peoples are coming on fort for the delicious food. Sinhgad is more attractive in rainy days.",Sinhagad
"KODAIKANAL is one of the very Popular Holiday Destinations of South India. It is referred to as the ""Princess of Hill Stations"" and it stands 7200 feet above sea level resting on the upper Palani Hills of the Western Ghats near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. History states that this is the only Indian Hill Station developed by the Americans. Now here are some of the Pointers on how to get in to Kodaikanal. > BY AIR: Madurai( 120 kms) , Coimbatore( 170 kms) and Trichy( 150 kms) are the nearest Airports to Kodaikanal. Direct Bangalore to Kodaikanal flights are unavailable. Those who are keen on flying can opt to take a flight to one of these airports and then opt for the roadways. > By RAIL: Kodaikanal Road Train station is nearly 85 kms to Kodaikanal. There are many direct trains from Bangalore to Kodaikanal and the known one are the Tuticorin Express and the Nagarcoil Express. > By ROAD: Kodaikanal is very well connected with all the major Towns via roadways and a good number of Buses are available. The Bangalore to Kodaikanal distance of approximately 470 kms and can be covered within 7 hours with steady driving. Self Drive is a good option so that the journey will be more comfortable with rest stops and local sight seeing on the way. The road is tarred and broad and is safe even at nights( what I felt) . Now Popular Sightseeing Places: KODAI LAKE > The Kodai lake, a man made structure of circumference of more than 5 km, is a beautiful place. Cycling, horse riding, walking and boating are the various activities that can be done there. BERIJAM LAKE > This lake covered almost by forest should be definitely at the first of the to do list in Kodaikanal.  Limited number of cars only allowed every day and we were told about 50-75 cars only allowed as per permit from the Forest department.  Rs.200/- will be charged as entry fee at the check post and a form needs to be filled. COAKERS WALK > Named after an Englishman Coakers walk is a one kilometer walk near a church. Located at height of 2150 metre this is a very good spot for a nice photo shoot with family over looking the Kodai Valley. PILLAR ROCKS > Please do not miss this view point. If you are lucky enough and there is not dense fog you will be able to see the two rocks which looks like pillars. Please be careful about the monkeys as they are very cunning and are very good at snatching things. GUNA CAVE > Trust me you will fell in love with this place. The small walk/trek from the counter gate till the caves is also great. These caves, earlier known as the ‘Devil’s Kitchen’, have now been fenced off due to the some unexpected accidents. But this is a great place for the Selfie Lovers. There are other places to be seen such as: Pine forest, Kurinji Andavar Temple, Poombarai Village View, La Saleth Church, Moir Point etc. Now where to STAY: There are many option for staying at Kodaikanal. Good and Budget hotels are available, the only thing we need to have a check is the availability. The best thing I love to have in Kodaikanal is the IDLI SAMBAR near the bus stand. An elderly couple will be serving hot IDLI, VADA and other stuff and it really taste great. Any one can get the taste from 6.30 AM till 11 AM. The best things that can be purchased for ourselves and our loved ones back home are the Home Made Chocolates, Tea Powder and a variety of Herbal oils with medicinal values. Now to conclude my review I will use my Title line, Indeed Kodai is an Awsome and evergreen destination which everyone should visit once.",Kodaikanal

"I just took opportunity to write a review on Goden temple located at Sripuram in Tamilnadu state.This is Lakshmi Narayani or Mahalakshmi temple coated with gold both interior and exterior.About 1.5 tonns of gold has been used and Rs 600 crore is spent to build the temple covers 55, 000 sq ft. We started our journey from Bangalore(Vijayanagar)on Saturday 11.00AM in my Swift. It was 12:30 when we reach Narayana hridayalaya due to traffic. I took 10 mins break then drove towards Hosur. This is NH7 neat road with cat eyes erected and borders are painted with white color, this helps a lot during the night driving. After driving about 45 kms, there is a toll plaza, near Krishnagiri, pay Rs25(One way) Next there are 2 flyovers, gon’t go over the 2nd flyover. Take left side lane, drive for a km, you get signal and take left(towards Chennai/Vellore) leaving behind the NH7, now you are on NH46. There is one more Toll plaza near Ambur, paid Rs 35, keep drove for another 10 mins.It was 2:30PM feeling hungry, found a hotel on the way(LHS), Motel Rosin, we had lunch, food quality was not good but there were no other options. We continued our journey and drove till Pallikondaj Toll plaza, paid Rs 45.When we were near to Vellore(5Km), I found a sign board to Sripuram.I asked a local person how to reach the Golden temple. He suggest 2 routes. One from Vellore the distance will be 13 Kms. And the 2nd route(Just 5 KMS) is from the same place where we asked him for the route.(I am sorry, I don’t remember that place.) I decided to take 2nd option because it was 4:00PM and if I go Vellore city, it may take more time due to traffic. Road was very narrow but good, there are 2 -3 small villages on the way and need not to ask anybody about the rout. Because once they spot the car, they show you the rout even before you ask them. They knew those vehicles are heading toward Golden temple. After driving 3 Km, mud road starts and drove for another 2 Km. We reached the backside of the temple and drove along the compound wall till the main entrance.There were many Pay –n – Park sign boards on the road. For safety reason, do not park anywhere, but go the temple premises pay Rs 10 and park your vehicle. Temple timings: 07:00AM to 9:00PM(queue will be closed by 8:30PM). Restrictions: Mobile phones/cameras not allowed. Need to submit at the special counter and get the receipt or keep them in your car. Girls with mini skirts(even if the age is 6-8 Yrs) are not allowed to enter the temple. In this case, you need to buy a cloth from the nearby shop located in temple premises(security persons will suggest where to buy and what to buy). With Free Darshan, you have to walk through the queue complex just like in Tirupati, It will take 2-3 Hrs.With Rs 150, you will skip the queue complex and directy enter the temple, but you need to walk through the star shaped path to reach the main temple.With Rs 250 Darshan, you will be allowed to sit for 10 mins in the temple near to Amma and offer special pooja. You have to pass through the two levels of security check inside the temple. People should walk through the star shaped path way to reach the temple. It is about 1.5 KM.The messages of'Amma' and quotes from Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Quran are displayed On either side of the pathway. Though the people's focus will be on the temple in gold. Temple is surrounded by water; I found coins, notes and even some visiting card thrown in water. We took Amma’s darshan and there for 15 minutes in the temple.After receiving Prasadam, we moved out of temple and walk through the star shaped path way. On the way back, you will find Tea stalls also. It is worth to pay a visit. The landscape, beautiful scenery, good atmosphere, greenish lawns, fine architecture and 2 tons of gold all combined makes one feel worth of the visit. There is huge, well maintained restaurant in the temple premise.",Sripuram
At starting of every winter I always visit eco park for picnic with my friends and family.So here is my review about the park. If we talk about the accessibility of the park its very big park and have many things to explore there first of all park is decorated with flowers plant and some kind of rare fruit plants again this park also include some staffs which makes ur picnic memorable like cycling boating and other water and land based rides. If we talk about local site seeing we can find here dummy sets of seven wonders of the world and many other things like water musical fountain which entertain you fully. Hotels inside the park is quite expensive but as the maintenance of the park is quite well its worthy to spent some extra money. Park is save and secure because it's under 24×7 cctv surveillance and have many security guards to take care of the park. It is the best park in the city and I recommend everyone to visit this park for picnic.,Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata

3 days ago I have been to kolkata.At evening I had to return so I was searching a place to spend some time someone suggested me to visit Eco park so I went there. This park is very good and eco friendly park. Accessibility is good lot of plants and flowers in the park can attract people. Different varities of flowers and plants you can see there. The park is safe for visitors as cctv camera is there. Local sight seeing is good there is a dummy of seven wonders in the park which looks great. Restaurants inside the park is quite expensive. The park is well maintained and clean. The best thing is there is so much space outside for parking Overall it is a good place to hanging out with friends.,Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata
I visited this park on last month with my some friend. Eco Park is a big natural park and very good place that I know from my friends. But after visiting my concept was totally changed. What a bad management of this park. I saw almost every conner of the park is full of couple and their sextual activities. I just wondered to see that no one of the park management staff looked up those activities. So friends if u plan to visit this park please don't come with your family. Besides its cleaning may be not done every day because I saw many plastics and garbage on the road inside the park. Otherwise its natural seen is good. Specially in winter it became more attractive. That's my opinion.,Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata
"Daltonganj got its name afetr Edward Dalton, who was the district commissioner of this area.It is a city in Jharkhand. I visited this place during a marriage of a friend.We took train from Kolkata and got down at Daltonganj. Their is no direct train to daltonganj, few trains from kolkata goes via Daltonganj and give a stopage for 5-10 min maximum.The city has a touch of both modern city and old city.The city has both shopping mall and old old monuments. We have gone there in the month of March for seven days.We visited few historical places and the famous Betla National Park.We visited Palamau Fort in Aurangabad .The forts are between the forest.The fort are in very bad condition .Belta National park is famous for tigers.The park also has bears, wolf, jackal and hyena.The park is a great place but needs some maintenance. Hanuman temple is also a nice place to visit which is located in the center of daltonganj main market. The place is best to visit in March as it gets too hot in the month of summer.The places are need serious maintenance specially the forts. People who are living nearby the states should visit this place. Belta national park is a must visit place for people who loves wild live photography and loves nature.",Daltonganj

"A sneak peak at Bangalore's musical fountain located at Indira Gandhi Musical Fountain Park, Raj Bhawan Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560052 can be found on my youtube channel. Just navigate the link: youtube.com/watch?v=vfxBBoS6CG8 Review:- Not exactly an awesome place but a place you might want to visit if you are at Bangalore & have some evening time to spare. Spoiler Alert: Music & Fountain showers may or may not be in sync with each other - so you might have to occasionally switch your audio visual faculties of your mind.:) Watch this video for the experience. Though the kids might enjoy this place, couples would be bored to death:) Overall a nice picnic spot for kids(below 10) followed by a musical fountain. Dont take your teenagers with you - you would be mocked for life:D There are lot of show timings for this but I would suggest to go in the dark to get a better feel of it. Overall it may be a worth seeing place with defined targeted audience",Bangalore

It is connected in all four ways- air, rail, road and sea. This city has a huge container base, a natural harbor, a film city, ship building company and the list goes on. A well planned city with greenary all around and a must visit for all the people who love travelling and exploring.",Visakhapatnam

"Hii friends, This is Deepak Jangra and I would like to share my personal experience with the Eco Park, New Town, Kolkata. This review is regarding as my personal experience with this place. Recently I visited this place when I and my friends went out on a tour of Kolkata. We visited this place on 24 Dec. 2017. This is an amazing place with natural beauty. This place is famous for its natural beauty.  The trees , plants are full of green. We specially went there to see this place because one of my friend admired this place very much. When we saw this place I thought that my friend told right. There are the copies of seven wonders of the world. There are looking good. There are many beautiful gardens including rise garden and butterfly garden etc. The people of this place are very good in behaviour and helpful.  The hotel facilities is good. They give a good service to the touristers. But they are a little expensive but it is affordable as compare to their facilities. There is no fear of any danger because this place is away from city and there is no fear of robbery or natural and artificial problems. This is a amazing place which give a piece of mind.  The people who wants to see natural beauty should see this place. Thanks for reading my review.",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata
"I have visited to Eco Park- New Town Kolkata on last year with my family. The entry fee was 20 INR each. I have found the park has not maintained well. There polytene bags surrounds this place, even the staffs doesn't take measure about this. We went for boating with my family, we were charged 150 INR for 30 minutes boat rides and we have found that loving couples were doing nude activities, I felt very awkward in front of my family. The management should restrict such activities in this park. Even the water bodies has not been maintained well as food wastes were floating over the water. The food which we had in this restaurants were very expensive comparing to others, we were charged one plate of chicken showmen 150 INR, 2 litre Kinley mineral water cost 35 INR which is expensive comparing to others. During the return, the empty buses were not available, very time it was fully packed bus in this place. Even the autos were not available here.I haven't had good experience over here. So I can suggest don't go for boating in this park with your kids or with your friends as you can noticed uncensored activities by the couples.",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata
"Hello Friends ! It's my pleasure to share with you my honest opinion for visiting Eco Park, New Town, Killamarsh.I am visit here for several times.In Kolkata it was a average place for spending some times.In Eco Park lot of people go for picnic & Romance, specially in holidays.In New Town Eco Park is an Urban Park in Rajarhat, Kolkata & the biggest Park so far in India.But, there was nothing interesting to do compare to the other parks.If you visit here for the first time then you will be enjoying good but, after 2/3 times you are felling so boring.The accessibility of this place was not good for the visitors.The local sightseeing of this place was good for the tourisum & the price of the tickets was also reasonable.The safety of this place was also good, local police was always available.Eco Park  was a family Park but, now young generation of boys & girls go here for romance so, if you visit here with children so, Beware.In one day trip it was a average place for visiting & spending some hours with you family & friends. Thanks,",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata
"Eco park - such a huge land area but notjing to do or enjoy. No proper shades ornplace for shelter is there, washrooms are one or two in such massive area. Rhe whole excitement of going eco park of mine has just ruined away by seeing there nothing to do, just a plain garden to roam about . The seven wonders consists of another ticket money but for what the eco park enttry ticket was , though it has nothing to do with. The workers for the boat riding were too not co operative and misbehaved with me by his sarcasm talks. No proper food or canteen. No safety in water ball game as it is lying in open water.",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata

"Hello friends today I am writing my 71st review on mouthshut.com. today my reviews related to one of the biggest city of India latest Bangalore. As we all know that Bangalore is one of the best and important city of India it is located in the southern direction of Indian peninsula yeah I admit that the temperature is little bit high and the humidity is always high in the southern side due to equator . The city is very very much easily accessible it has enormous number of bus stops, it has railway station, airport . The number of cab apps available on Play Store and IOS nowadays such as Ola Cabs and at Sector are also available in this city as it is one of the biggest city of India which type of cabs are not available in all the cities they are some specific cities where these type of cabs are available. The locality of the city are not up to the mark . The local sighting is very very bad due to lack of greenery, trees etc . The sighting is words in some of the regions of the city due to garbage which is spread here and there, lack of Administration, lack of greenery, sewage is also field up at the top and in rainy season the sewage water comes out on the road it is one of the biggest problem of the city . There are various regions where the living quality and Lifestyle standards are very poor . The biggest problem that people face in this city is Number of hotels available at economy price . I am not saying that this in the city the hotels are less but the hotels are available is a at very high rates that are 5 or 7 star rating hotels or at very low rate which are below standard hotels in which you can't stay . The city is also not safe in any aspect you can find a number of robberies, accident and rape cases . Density is not at all safe for girls specially at night as other big cities are . At last but not least I will not suggest you to go to this setting as a tourist yeah you can go to the city for your personal work .",Bangalore
"I am very excited when my family decided to visit Bangalore after my examinations. I feel myself lucky enough that I got opportunity to visit IT City of India. And ofcourse, Bangalore is best place to visit in India. If I say about safety, the whole city is peacefully protected by policemen and policewomen. There are several May I Help You corners for new citizens, tourists and victims for help. At night they provide protection in whole city by setting policemen in every streets. And on roads the jeep will pass with two policemen each. Roads are quite excellent and as we know Bangalore is a rainy place, drainage is perfect for that place. The sight seeing places are very much decorated by the government and there are many places to visit like Bangalore Palace, many IT companies, Vrindavan Garden and nearby cities like Mysore, Ooty etc. I can't say anything about hotel because I stayed in my brother's rent house, but it was very much designable and everything is desgined according to Bangalore's weather. Transportation in Bangalore is very easy, every minute there are bus services which are governmental and private too. Several cabs operators are providing proper services. Really my journey to Bangalore and it's very interesting place to visit. Also known as IT City of Karnataka.",Bangalore

"Good Morning to all the viewers of I will start with ""THEN"" I moved to Bangalore in the year 2012 as I had got an offer to work with Infosys.I was very excited to be in Bangalore as it was always a Dream and I still remember my first PG which was in a very good locatity in HSR Layout. I felt at that time that the weather of Bangalore was very pleasent and I was also observing frequest rains which made the climate more chilled. Traffic too was bearable as I just hopped in to the Office Transport vehicle and would reach office and then back home. Didn't had so many friends and so was not used to all the places in Bangalore at that time. I along with two of my PG friends would just roam about the near by places. Saturdays and Sunday we use to Visit the Nearby Forum Mall and enjoy meals and sometimes also hit the Cinemas. Almost around 3 years passed by the same way. Explored further some of the best shopping places like MG ROAD, Brigade ROAD, Jayanagar 4th Block etc but always felt that it was quiet Expensive. Within this 3 years I also have seen that the climate of Bangalore had changed a lot and also Traffic too has increased. Life was going on untill I met the best person in my life with whom I am happily married for about 2 years now. Bangalore ""NOW"": After I got married I feel like I have known the entire Bangalore within just 1 month. Being with a person who has a craze for Mean Machines like Cars and Bikes I have seen that Bangalore has become a very small place for me. But to all the readers I want to let them know that Bangalore has become Bengaluru and so does many of the things. Now I will highlight some of the things that can be done in Bangalore and I feel this will help any new travellers. a. How to Travel to Bengaluru. This is something that I would like to give a thumbs up. Bengaluru is well connected will all the modes of Tranport viz, Airways, Railways and Road Transport. Bengaluru's International Airport is also listed among the Best airports in Asia. There are many Trains that run from all parts of India to Bengaluru ony thing one needs to make sure to book the tickets before hand. Excellent Bus services both Sleeper and Semi-sleeper is also available for Bangalore from almost other South India states and some Norther States like Gujarat and Rajasthan. b. Where to stay: Well one can find N number of Hotels here in Bangalore. Budget hotels till Hotels will Multiple Stars are also available for the service. I will advise to better check the availability and the price of the hotels online and then pre-book. c. Food: Now this is something that I am very fond of, Food. Yes people I am a food-o-holic and we both travel many times to other places within the city to hunt for different cuisines. One can find all sort of Food whether it is North or South. What I will suggest is to visit the small caterers where in we can find some of the authentic food. I feel Tiffins or morning Breakfast items are good in Bangalore. d: What to do: Now many of the first visitors have Bangalore's Night Life in Mind. I would like to correct you that Bengaluru's night life ends by 11.30 PM as it is directed  by the Safety department. One can visit the Malls here which are indeed very huge and looks very charming. Here are the list of some of my Favourites: Garuda Mall near to MG road, Forum Mall at Koramangala, Bangalore Central Mall of JP Nagar, Mantri Square Mall at Malleshawaram and Lastly Phoenix Marketcity which is located in White Field. Now here are some of the other tourist places that can be visited in Bangalore: > Lal Bagh - This is a botanical Garden which has indeed a Royal Origin as it was started by HYDER ALI. Different kind of Flowers and other plants can be seen. > Bannerghatta National Park - Founded in 1970 and declared as a National park in 1974 this park is located in the Outskirts of Bangalore. One can visit that place and opt for the Safari rides which will give them a sight of Lions, Tigers, Bears and other animals. > ISKCON Temple - This temple is located in Rajajinagar and is a best place for Devotees and non-devotees to go and get some mental peace. > NANDI HILLS - Now this is a place which is one of my favourite. This place is around 70 kilometers from Bangalore city and is good for Nature lovers. One needs to be there at early hours so that the Sunrise can be seen. This is also a perfect spot for the people who loves to Ride or Drive on the Hills. > WONDERLA - This is an Amusement park that is located on the Bangalore-Mysore Highway and is around 35 kilometers from the city. All types of rides both dry and wet rides are available and the pools are the main attraction. > Other places to vivit: Cubbon Park, Tipu's Place, Bangalore Fort, Bangalore Palace, Vidhana Soudha and also Museum. There is lot that can be written about this Beautiful city which is turning to be very polluted these days but time is less and spaces are confined. Any one who is planning to visit Bengaluru please make yourself ready for the Traffic congestion and rest all is fine. This is a safe city and always welcomes guests.",Bangalore
"The city of Bangalore, capital of Karnataka in india is one of he major cities in india. Located in the Deccan platue in the south of the country, which is well connected with the rest of the country. The climate is mild and pleasurable when compared to the rest of the country. The city is famous for its pub culture, gardens and IT and scientific community. But now the city is going through a transformation, I don’t know if it’s for good or bad. I’ve been living in the city from few years now and below are my observation. The locals are good and approachable and the city boasts its own cultural thing which is nice. The people from all walks of life and all corner of the world living hear means you will bump into someone, which makes you feel good. It is a good city to make a living/money but tits such that initially you really gotta hustle a lot or should have a fat bank balance. Now the bad parts, which takes away all the good side of the city, that is traffic. Traffic in the city is unbearable and the narrow curvy roads makes navigating the city during rush hour a night mare. You may even take 3 hours to reach 20km. The roads on few parts of the city is bad. The local city buses are good but they ply on their own time and the service is too less after 9-10pm. The city is connected with Metro now but it covers a very small part which is not reliable everyday. So because if this living here is difficult. Before the city was known for its night life and the music festivals too. Things have changed now from last 2 years. Few big international shows were cancelled in the city a year back. There was an argument about the right to host the concert between the event management company and the local governing body. They did not reach a happy ending, which left both parties dour after that there is drastic reduction in the number of events that happens in the city. It’s also the beer capital of the country which has one of the highest consumption of beer and has the highest number of beer taps in the country. But now most of the good ones are super expensive and the renewing ones are shady and sub par. The city is expensive in comparison to other cities. Of course you will get what you pay but the bar is high. The rickshaws in the cities are nightmare and it’s best to avoid. In the end if you have some local connection in Bangalore, the city still opens up to another beautiful side and hidden gems. But it’s restricted and is not accessible to most and definitely not the tourist crowd.",Bangalore
"This city is also called as garden city and many attractive places have been located around bangalore. This city is also known for its software services and always baggs the number one title in terms of IT development in India. The city is covered with enumerous gardens and parks which inturn make the pollution free city to some extend. Last year, I visited this city and the lookable places around it, at first I went to tipu sultan's palace which was constructed around 1400 s . The palace is a treat to watch. It was a simple resting palace for the mysore kings, later it was occupied by the british viceroys and long later it was merged with archeaology department of India. it is filled with lot of architecture and a great deal of engineering involved in it. The walls are painted with artistic paintings, throwing light on, how that medieval era was, and the main events that took place on that time. The palace is surrounded with beautiful gardens of tulips and cornered by water fountains. After this palace I visited sri chamundeshwari temple , this temple is a special one to me as it is located on a hilltop . The temple is a example for modern engineering and architecture. After the darshan, we marched to nearby mysore street shop gathering, there we purchased some shoes and left. After this we went to a catheral church I dont remember the exact name , it is treated as the second tallest church in india after medak catheral church. Later we started to see a old hindu vishnu temple , there we have seen, a lot of stone sculptures which reflects the hindu dharma and samskruthi ( tradition) and later we  visited the nearby hotel to have food. After that we visited the grandeur mysore palace. The greatest of its kind . I was awestruck after seeing the palace. The paintings, the elephants, the loyal gardens .just mindblown. This visit was incomplete without seeing the mysore majestic palace.  At night we visited the mysore gardens. Overall the trip is filled with amusement and thrill. It was a golden chance for me to retrieve my inner need for art and architecture of majestic and incredible india.  Jai hind.",Bangalore
"I have been in Bangalore since last 2 year. It is very nice. Main thing about Bangalore is its weather. Its always cool. Even in summer time in home, we don't need AC. Now it is softaware hub in India. All major IT company offices are in Bangalore. Because of software job, many people have migrated from other parts of India and now they become permanent residence in Bangalore. There are many places to visit in Bangalore. Few of them are Bannerghatta national park, Lal Bagh, Tipu Sultan summer palace, Vidhan Soudha, Science museum,  cubbon park and many gardens in city. Its other name is Garden City of India. Over the years, because of increasing population, beauty of this city is going down and is infamous for its traffic Jam. Still it is my favorite city to live.",Bangalore

"To visit this wonderful place of greenery I booked a cab and it took around 1 hour 20 minutes to reach Eco Park. After reaching this place it gives a calmness to the soul of the body and the cold air blowing in the season of summer refreshes the body from hair to fingertips and feels like tension free. The water bodies are like a patches on the green field which glorifies the beauty of this locationThe Eco Park is a place where people from Kolkata and visitors to the city can go to spend a fun day with their family. Nature and serenity are the two key elements of the park. Everyone enjoy and several fun activities can be noticed on the park.Many plants, herbs and shurbs are there in the park, looks like those are peeing us all around the ground.Different kinds of butterflies and birds species roam in sky, like they are guarding us and enjoying the beautu freely, by seeing them I make wish that if I can also fly.Food court with restaurant and cafeteria makes our mood on with some delicious food in our belly.Walking on the grass without footwear gives a feeling of walking on a velvet.The safety is appropriate, the member of security are always available for proper eye on everything. Anyways everyone is more careful for themselves and also great salute to security members.After visiting this place there is no reason to go back from this place but there are several reasons to stay at this place. I advice mouthshut family to visit this place once in their lifetime. #MouthShutTraveller",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata

Bangalore the capital city of karnataka. Bangalore is always crowded with people. The local people here are not so friendly for outsiders. They just see the outsiders as buisiness tool. Traffic here is hectic. You waste your half of your journey here on the traffic only. Food is also not so good here. Street foods are found everywhere. Not many nice places to visit here. Weather is cool in winter and very hot in summer. Accessibility is quite good in this place. But not much local sightseeing. You only get to see political party buildings and mornuments. Some park here and there. Bangalore is a big city. To travel 50 km inside bangalore it will take ages because of bangalore traffic. Hotels and accomodation is vast here because many IT and industries are in bangalore. Not a safe place at night. I dont recommend bangalore for tourists.,Bangalore

Actully down of the statue there is small cave where there inside is story of the Maha Shivling at the time of RAVANA. The story tells that RAVANA was a great devotee of LORD SHIVA and after years of praying he requested Maha Shivling to LORD SHIVA to give it to RAVANA' s mother. But for security reasons to give someone Maha Shivling is not safe so LORD GANAPATI achieved the Maha Shivling with a trick. This is one of attraction to see there. Hotels there can be said are a bit coastly but is worth spending as u get best view and facilities.I would recommend everyone to get time and visit as it can be said is a MUST VISIT place. Enjoyed, roamed, got info, and many more so was one of best trip of my life.",Murdeshwar
"Hi frnds, Some years back I have visited Murudeshwar . I hav never  see Such a wonderful place located in the sea shore.

Mookambika temple is located near 60 km away from here.So we can include Mookambika temple also in our  route.There lot of hotels, lodges and other acomodation fascilities are available. Better choose day time to travel Murudeswar to Mookambika.",Murdeshwar
"Highly insensitive people who has no care for humans and even for dogs. Two such incidents. One lady without looking directly crossed the road. Poor fellow suddenly hold the break and saved himself from hitting but badly got hurt as his bike fell down. Now comes drama: The local people starts scolding him. I don't know what for. Second: A dog was sleeping in the side of a street and a car directly ran over the sleeping dog and killed it. A little puppy. Some local folks on the same street was taking care of them and they just demanded an apology. Now comes the second drama. Some other local powerful folks comes over and says ""It's just a street dog, what ever happened as happened. Whats there ? It's dead. OK. Now leave"". How insensitive these people are. Have caution. Local films making such things may mostly be political powerful. And this is kind of IT capital of India. What guarantee does this city gives to the tourists or even possibly to the company employees. Where as I have been in Chennai and my experience is just awesome local people. They treat you with respect. Here you get scolded unless you are one of them.",Bangalore
"Hei guys, I had been to Murudeshwara in my childhood with parents, I really enjoyed the trip play at water , infact I started loving Lord Shiv ji from that period & still continues, awesome sightseeing and now a days film industry also loves to shoot in the temple surroundings, A mega serial ( Drama) NANDHINI has been shot recently and it is so successful in all 3 south languages.",Murdeshwar

I visited Murdeshwar some time ago and it was a really nice trip for me and my family. It was such a nice place. The weather was very beautiful and the greenery in the area made it look more beautiful. It was little bit difficult to access through that area because of bad weather and risky roads. The local sightseeing was very nice. The Lord Shiva statue was very beautiful and the mountains and greenery also. The hotels were available at reasonable rates. The prices were on the lower side. There was no safety concern while staying in Murdeshwar. I would definitely recommend this place to every person specially spiritual ones.,Murdeshwar

VIDHAN SABA(ASSEMBLY), LAL BAGH, COUPONS PARK are the important Picnic Places in Bangalore. Vidhan Saba was built in ancient times. It shows our old culture & Civil work. when I saw lal Bagh I wondered because its a big Park. I enjoyed there lot of times. In coupons Park I saw lot of Rose Flowers & surprised.

"Kodaikanal is one of the most popular hill stations in South India. Kodaikanal has the most pleasant weather throughout the year. It is at an altitude of 20133 metres above the sea level and offers breathtaking views all around. We reached Kodaikanal on 10 am, usually we drive to Kodaikanal and it took just 3-4 hrs. Then we checked in a hotel. and started to explore the Misty Heaven. Kodaikanal is around 490 kms from Bangalore. We traveled through the Madurai highway. There were many hotels but we liked to stay in a normal Hotel with a restaurant nearby. That was my Favorite Restaurant ever, The Monkey Restaurant. All the foods from Triangular dosa to Mango ice cream everything was just wonderful. Kodaikanal is a typical hill station and all hill stations are centred around the lake. The town is on a hillock with selfie spots sceneies all over. Greenery and mountains to explore and embrace you, wherever you go. The biggest attraction of Kodaikanal is the weather. Temperatures never rose above 20-25 degrees. Even during the summers the city of Kodaikanal would be the cool place. Sightseeing is the best thing to do here. there are many things to see here, like the Coakers walk, lakes, Byrant Park, Upper lake view, Moier view point, Suicide point, Pillars rock, Bear Shola Falls, Silver cascade falls, And much more, The place is truly to be called as the Misty Heaven. I recommend this place to everyone around the world to Take a peaceful walk in the city of Kodaikanal.",Kodaikanal
"Eco Park is located in Rajarhaat, New Town. One of the busiest place in Kolkata during office hours. But after you enter the park you will forget the outside world and start living the beauty of the place. Eco Park is the largest park in India so you can imagine how big it is! The park has a huge collection of plants, it also has an orchid garden, cactus garden, bamboo garden, and many more. I went there in the winter and I found thousands of seasonal flowers in the garden. They have an area where you can find different species of butterfly flying above you. This is so mesmerizing and heart whelming. I totally loved it. It also has huge water bodies and at evening they organize water and light show which is again a treat for our eyes. They also have museums and Biswa Bangla Swarani where the old heritage of Bengal is kept alive. According to me this is one of the best place in India which you cannot afford to miss. Recently they have included the replica of the Seven Wonders of the World in the park which is a great inclusion for the viewers. Eco Park is located in such a place that it is accessible from almost every part of Kolkata. You can easily book an Ola or Uber and reach here. You can also come by public transport. Very soon metro service will also start so reaching Eco Park is not a problem. Sight scene, I have already told you but what I haven’t told you is you can easily come here with your family or friends for picnic. Huge playgrounds are there where you can sit and can do different activities. An amphitheater is also there. It’s a lovely place. There are not many hotel near the park but within a range of 5-15km you will find many hotels. This place is under government so safety is not an issue. This place is very safe according to me. This is a must visit place and I recommend to u guys. You will really enjoy the place. Thousands of people visits the park daily. So what are you waiting for? Let’s go!",Eco Park - New Town - Kolkata

"Hi I have visited this place during off-season for the first time in my life. This place is surrounded by lots of tourist attraction and plenty of tree and hill sides. I went there from madurai to kodaikanal from a bike around 150kms, the bike ride itself was so exciting. I have enjoyed the ride stress free since the traffic was less and not too cold, ideal for small children's. Pro- .scenic place .you'll forget all your stress once you go up the mountain .Good road conditions .Less pollution .scenery places like pine forest, berijam lakes, guna caves etc are worth to see atleast once in a life time Cons- .It'll get little crowded in season time .You need to be a very good driver to climb up the hill, esp during season time. .little too narrow and dangerous roads in some places .might get too cold during night times, hence keep a blanket handy .some resorts or hotels will charge extra to give you a scenic rooms, if you book hotel rooms online like oyo, makemytrip Area of improvement- .most of the hotels are expensive, hence some had to go to road side shops .it's dangerous during night time, due to lack of street lights while climbing up the hill. .Visibility is less during night and foggy times.",Kodaikanal

I bought a slipper for 500 rs. I Used that slipper just two weeks only. Slipper got damaged within two weeks, that is the product quality of their product what they sold to visitors. The  lake is beautiful instead the water is murky and is full of algae.The boating facility is good which they provided.

The caves are now well barricaded due to unexpected accidents but can be viewed from a man made tower. These are much more things that can be done there shopping, eating and driving through the pine forest etc. Overall Kodaikanal is indeed my Favorite Hill-Station of South India and I look forward for mt fifth visit soon.",Kodaikanal
"Dear friends, I visited Kodaikanal in 2007. its most memorable thing in my life. so I would like to share my memorable experience! Kodaikanal is sistuated in Tamilnadu near Dindigul. Kodaaikanal is one of the best Hill Station in India. It is situated above 2000 meters from the Sea level. so we can enjoy cool Climate there! Lot of Sightseeing in Kodaiknal. GUNA CAVE, VIEW POINT, LAKE AREA are the important Picnic spots in Kodaikanal. Kodaikanals Lake is very deep. But boating experience given me a good experience in a low cost. near the Lake I saw a big Rose garden & I wondered. I made Horse riding on the road. Lot of Horses are availible for low rent for riding! I stayed in a good Hotel with nominal cost only. Plenty of Hotels & Star Hotels are availible there. Accomodations cost is acceptable. Because Rs.500 per day is not a big thing for a common man! Kodaiknal is the saftey place to stay there. Because I stayed there 3 days. There is no doubt abou saftey problem.",Kodaikanal
"This place has got amazing view from the top. You will definitely find peace here. Visit in morning for better experience. Also roads from highway to fort will put u in little trouble. But overall experience will be great! Go with your friends, family. You will also find some canteens there and great food at cheap rate. Must visit if you are visiting any other place nearby. 4",Sinhagad

"You always feel comfortable to express your feelings about the things that you like the most. Travelling, climbing are my favourite activities. I am writing this review based on my previous visit to singhgad fort. (As a Puneite I am a regular visitor of this fort. It is just that the new motherhood has kept me away for a a while). I intend to start my activities this monsoon. If you do not exercise regularly, you climb the Sinhagad fort every Sunday morning. This is the mantra of most of the people in pune. The climb starts before sunrise. It is about one and half hour climb. You reach the top have breaksfast (local food) then start descending. Reach the foot of the fort by 10 am. Reach home by 11am and spend your holiday as you wish. Visiting Sinhagad Time to visit: Any time of the year be it summer, winter or rains Distance from Pune : 26 kms. Height :approx 700-800mts (only) How to reach the fort: Obviously reach Pune first. From Pune station or better would be to reach the Swargate ST stand. There are many city buses that ply from Swargate ST stand. The city buses take you to the sinhagad gaon (village). For Tourist : There are many options to reach the top of Sinhagad fort via TumTum(ie share rickshwas). Dept of tourism has a bus going(I have never travelled..But I know it is there). Pvt vehicles, jeeps and blah blah..There is absolutely no problem in reaching the fort. You need not take the pains of climbing the fort. There is a tar road right upto the top. For trekkers : Reach the ''paytha'' or the foot of the fort. The paytha is accessible via the sinhagad village. It is around 25-30 mins walk to the ''paytha'' from the village. Once you reach the paytha ..then..then go ahead start climbing. You can climb during day, during night (chandani raat mein) anytime. If you decide to start early in the morning the best would be to stay overnight at the hotels in the sinhagad gaon. If you really want to trek, then you should consider trekking Sinhgad via Katraj (the seven mountain trek. this is again another subject). History : The fort was conquered by Tanaji Malasure on behalf of Raje Shivaji. (It is very interesting to read about the battle and the way it was conquered. I will not write about it in this.) On the top to see : Dev Take - famous tank with sweet and cold water. Tanaji's samadhi on the fort. The tower of Doordarshan is also there on Sinhagad. You can see the Panshet, Khadakwasla and Varasgaon dams and Torana fort also. To add to it The view of entire Pune city looks splendid. when you visit sinhagad. If you do so you will be missing on the taste of the Maharashtrian village deliacy. You may carry water with you. Once you reach the top there is a cool water tank on the fort. People keep visiting sinhgad fort for the scenic beauty, but more so for the food. There are many huts of the villagers on the top of the fort. They prepare garam garam",Sinhagad
"After a short halt at Sinhagad, kick start your bike to go into deeper jungles. Maval Srusti, after less than a hour’s ride you will reach a peaceful and pollution-free resort amidst thick forests. The resort is on top of a hill and the view of the valley is awesome, surrounded by thick forest. This resort is a project by the Joshi's - contributing their bit to conserving the nature. Several variety of plants are planted all over; no campfire allowed as it requires cutting of trees and closer home - no smoking or drinking or television or tape recorder. And that is precisely what gives you time and peace to enjoy a game of table tennis, carrom and a relaxed swim. Food is Maharastrian complete with a sweet dish and I should say dinner was better than lunch. Afternoon snack and tea are welcomed, specially if you are visiting on a cloudy day. The room service is pleasant, ready with a smile on their faces. Another highlight is the beautiful waterfall , which comes after over a 100 steps. It is a trek with beautiful plants and flowers along the way. We even caught an ant-hill! Photographers, nature lovers, gardeners or just about anyone - one place beautiful to occupy anybody - and don't forget to stand a while and smell the nature all over you. The experienced of riding up a hill and living in a thick forest was just wonderful. The clouds were touching the hill - tops but then they got the rains as well. Got some beautiful pictures.",Sinhagad
"Kodaikanal is one of the most popular hill stations in South India. Kodai has the most pleasant weather throughout the year. It is at a hieght of 2133 metres above sea level and offers breathtaking views all around. After visiting the other two hill stations of South - Yercaud and Ooty, I was curious to know how Kodai was. We set out for Kodai by road and my research on the net indicated that it was 7.5 to 8 hours drive. But in the end it took 10 hours! The lesson I learnt was not to believe everything on the net. The road from the entrance to Kodai to the hills will itself take 1.5 hours. Reaching Kodai Kodaikanal is around 490 kms from Bangalore and the road to take is the  Salem-Dharmapuri-Dindigul route. We need to take a deviation on the Madurai highway. There are trains available (which are all booked 3 months in advance), which stops at Kodai Road station, from where you need to catch a bus or taxi (1.5 hours) to reach Kodai. For those who want to fly, nearest airport is Madurai, which is 128 kms away. Staying in Kodai There are many hotels in Kodai, but the popular ones like Kodai Resort, Sivapriya, Villa Retreat are difficult to get in the peak season unless you reserve 10-15 days in advance. We settled on a new hotel called Silver Springs, which turned out to be a real gem (review on the hotel posted separately). There are a large number of hotels, so even if you walk in without a booking you can get rooms, but quality is not reliable! About Kodai Kodaikanal is a typical hillstation and like all hillstations is centred around the lake. The town is on a hillock with picturesque sceneries all over. Greenery and mountains embrace you, wherever you go. The biggest attraction of Kodaikanal is the weather. Temperatures never rise above 20-25 degrees. We visited Kodai in the peak of summer. It was sweltering heat in the cities below the hills., But the moment we entered Kodai, it was like stepping into heaven. A light spell of rain ensured that the weather turned chilly! Mist everywhere makes it a visual treat. Another interesting note is that most hotels in Kodai have no fans or AC - the reason is of course the cool weather. The summer nights were actually cold and you may even need sweaters! Even when the sun is blazing in the sky, you still experience a cool breeze - real heaven! And you see the sun in the sky and the next minute, mist all around - thats an amazing experience not to be missed. Eating out There are a wide variety of options to eat out in Kodai. Hotel Astoria, Sivapriya are popular. But our choice was Annapoorna on 7 Roads junctions, which offered excellent breakfast and South Indian meals. Another little restaurant which offered homely North Indian food was Rasoi near the bus stand. Rasoi and another restaurant Punjabi Ghar next to it is run by a Punjabi lady. The restaurant offers tasty and homely North Indian food. Chapathis, Theplas, lassi and a array of side dishes all of which are tasty and not very expensive. Other options include Pizza Corner, Hotel Woodlands, etc. Also, at all of the sight seeing places, you get healthy snacks like roast corn and a special bhel puri that uses boiled groundnuts, carrot, mango, etc. Carrots and plums are a specialty of Kodai and available at many places and are fresh and tasty. Shopping Around the lake you can buy sweaters, jerkins, and a lots of other things.  But the main shopping area is on 7 Roads junction and near the bus stand. Home made chocolates in a main shopping attraction. Eucalptyus oil, spices like cinnamon, cloves, etc are sold everywhere. Coffee and tea are other shopping attractions. Things to do Sightseeing of course is the main thing to do in Kodai. There are so many things to see there, that I am writing another review on the sightseeing in Kodai. Some of the tourist attractions are the Lake, Coakers walk, Bryant Park, Upper lake view, Moier view point, Suicide point, Pillars rock, Bear shola falls, Silver cascade falls, Guna caves (Devils kitchen), Observatory, etc. http://www.mouthshut.com/review/General_tips_on_Travel-191904-1.html Apart from the sight seeing places, you can spend quality time near the lake. There are parks surrounding the lake, where you can relax and also where children can play. There are other attractions around the lake, like a skating area, where adults and children can try their hand at skating. There is a 3D cinema show, book exhibition and other attraction",Kodaikanal
"Few places offer the variety of views that Sinhagadh can. The greenery in monsoon is simply awesome. The way clouds drift up the valley is indescribable. And here's also perhaps the sweetest natural water that I've ever had. It is located about 40 kms from Pune. One must visit the Khadakwasla Dam that's situated on the way to Sinhagadh. The lake is a good weekend getaway. Not only because of its natural beauty, but also because of its historical importance, this fort is a must see for anyone visiting Pune. It is best as a weekend getaway. Don't miss the ''kaandaa bhaji'' and ''chai''. The combination works wonders in the chill breeze that blows on the mountain tops - excellent for couples too. As with all such places, bunches of eve-teasers are always present, so one needs to be careful. This is true for Khadakwasla too. There are buses from Swargate to the foot of Sinhagadh. Scaling the hillock serves as a good trek - best during early summer.",Sinhagad
"I visit this place with my family tour. This is such a great place have seen. My family member and myself enjoyed a lot in Murudeshware beach.  Accessibility is superb. The Lord SIVA temple is very good. The Shiva is simple magnificent and the temple is maintained well as well. Its fantastic place to be. It took us around 3 hr to see each place. Local sightseeing is awesome, her in Murideshwara we can see our old construction to temple, which is height is too height from the land and it is nearer to ocean beach. Lord Siva is higher is 220 feet. In this place near more hotels available. Hotel is too good. Hotels and resorts near a beach side or walk-able distance from highway.  if you want to relax or tension free up your mind just go to this awesome place to spend time with your family members. This is cool relaxing place to spend a day or two. Along with the main attractions few water sport are there in some seasons. That place is very enjoyable. or this is plce is more secure and full with security guards available on site.",Murdeshwar
"We went to Murdeshwar after visiting our industrial visit 2months back. . The time we went there it was almost 7pm. The place we specially visited was the murdeshwar temple, it was the 1st time I went to this place and was mesmerised by the beauty of the temple, it is so much big having 2 large elephant statues in the front, a big shiva statue on the bed of the ocean, many statues of moans, krishna on ratha etc. The place is very well maintained. The temple is very beautiful. There are many hotels near by so there is no problem with accommodation and food. The local sightseeing are also good there is a beach next to the temple. The safety is good, police will not allow the people to visit the beach after 11pm.and there is thief problems. If you are visiting mangalore then pay a visit here, you will never forget the place.",Murdeshwar
"One of the best tourist attraction near to Pune. It's just 15 km from baner Pune . Best time to visit is rainy season. Fort was built by shivajee and it's compeltely ruined now. But best thing is the atmosphere you find in that hill is superb. The clouds are just moving around by touching to the ground. Completely filled with fog in rainy season where by you can not even see any thing at a distance of more than 10-15 feet. Huge amount of people used to visit in week ends, and parking 2/4 wheeler is a difficult task. Upto night 10 PM you can find crowd out there. Road to reach the fort is not very good and you have to be little care full. From the top of the fort you can see all the near by places and take good photos as well. Most of the people travelling are either couples or college students.",Sinhagad
Just about 30 km from pune is this beautiful fort..its not much of a fort now as its in ruins and you only could imagine what it must have been...not withstanding the maintanance the gov and the local bodies have done to restore it.. there are couple of routes to reach sinhagad...one obviously is via the sinhagad road via saras bag...another is from wakad via the road that passes behind the NDA...another route is from the pune-satatara road...longest yet the most beautiful route!! the food here is amazing and earthy...very basic yet delicious...bhakri pitla and kandha bhajji is amazing especially in the rainy season!! there are couple of cottages there like the tilak cottage and another private one and the pwd cottage is also available for which booking has to be done from pmc pune near sasoon hosp..however I prefer staying in a tent over there!!...check couple of photographs in my orkut profile...,Sinhagad

Hi guys as I have visited kodaikanal before 4 months and I have got a very bad experience while travelling here. As there are no hotels at all to live for the foreigners who are visiting from other countries or from other states in india. There are only rivers across kodaikanal and other interesting places are not there its only waste of time to go at this places. At this place very few people lives and very boring places are also there. And about hotels there are very very few hotels and also not tasty food at all. So I better suggest dont to go such places and get bored and also there is no safety at all all the peoples are not safe and the police department is also very lazy,Kodaikanal
"Sinhagad is hilly fortress made by Kaundilyas ago 2000 years . But in era of Mugal thugs . It was a House of Shivaji Maharaj. Mughal try many times but ""Jiska sacha iman , Uska hi Inam "". Shiva ji and Maratha rulers controlled over it.",Sinhagad
"Sihnagad fort is good place for trekking, nice view from top especially in Monsoon season.For 1 day trip. Sinhgad Fort is a very scenic place with a beautiful view all around. It is very nice to visit in the winter and during the monsoons. The Fort itself is a perfect example of neglect and administrative apathy. It is a place mostly used by trekkers to climb up from the base and for college students spending the afternoon with their friends or love interest. There is no decent toilet which can be a problem for women travellers. The road to this fort is so horrible.The zunka bhakri stalls offer this typical maharashtrian dish.prepared fresh.very cheap rates.taste.There are hawkers everywhere and people throw their waste around in this beautiful heritage. But my last visit of this fort is worst.Here some people's are misguide youand local cab opreater charge you double. if you coming your own vehicle thats good, but if your coming with local vehicle, then they charged you 50 rupee person, and after 6:00 pm they charge 100 rupee person.its too bad.",Sinhagad
"Sinhagad is a fort located near Pune. Shivaji Maharaj named it after his warrior Bajiprabhu who died in the battle. The fort is not well maintained but that doesn't mean you can't have a good time here. The fort has a very important historical significance and majors are being taken to preserve it. How can you get there? By Train: The nearest train station is Pune Station. From there you have to go either by bus or car or shared rickshaw. By Air: The nearest airport is Pune Airport. From there its either bus or cab. By road: You can go by road either in car or bus or shared rickshaw or by your own bike. The ride is really beautiful. The road is not that well maintained and there are many potholes but in the end its all worth it. Local sightseeing - There are many points you can see on Sinhagad. Since its a fort you can various doors and watch points of that time. The fort is surrounded by the Sahyadri mountains and the view is amazing for any given point. Sinhagad is a great place to get some quite and peace away from all the city noice. It is a great escape. Hotels and Accommodation - Hotels here are not exactly what you [picture a hotel to be. they are actually small hotels set up in a tent. If you are worrying about the quality of the food, don't! the food absolutely delicious and mouth watering. The menu on the fort is the same no matter where you go: kanda bhaji and zumka bhakar, curd. People come here for this special menu only. It is something you can't help but want more. You don't complain about there not being variety. The menu available is enough. The fort is more visited during rainy season as it is a great spot to go and enjoy the monsoon. The clouds are at your feet literally. You get to see the nature like never before and it breathtaking. This is a one day trip. Before you were not able to stay or camp on the fort but now there is lodge on the fort and you can stay there over night if you want. You have to book the rooms before hand. Safety - I have been going to Sinhagad since I was 2 years old or may be before that. I still haven;t had any alarming incident or any kind of worrying incident. The place is safe. You do have to be careful when you are on the edge of the mountain as it is quite a drop. Other than that no issues with the people. People are quite helpful.",Sinhagad
"Sinhagad fort is the best fort I have ever seen . it is about 30 to 50 kms ride from pune. we went by bike.  its a place with rich history. The best time to visit sinhagad is in rainy season. Also there are bus services available from pune to sinhagad. Nice place to go on weekend. Local snacks available on all over the hills. Trekking may take long time approx 1 hour depending on the person fitness so please carry water bottle, cap, sweater and wear shoes. Top view looks very beautiful. I like ""pithale bhakri"" and ""Kanda bhaji "" Wide range of hotels are available between pune to singhagad village like Hotel Samruddhi Inn, Shree Inn loudge and HMR Royal Inn. The road is not so good in condition. overall it was nice experience(specially trekking) I recommended to go in rainy season or in winter(early in the morning to view beautiful sun rise).",Sinhagad

"If you are tired of searching of a good picnic spot and you don't like too much crowed then this is the right place for you. Amazing place near kolkata, only 75 kms from Kolkata. Last month I went with my family and seriously we enjoyed a lot. This small island is located between Bhasa River and Ichamati River. And most amazing thing is that you can see the view of Bangladesh! I went to Hasnabad first and then I booked a motor boat from ferry dock to reach Machranga Dweep or Dwip.  This ammazing island is covered by trees and it's ideal for fun-filled day trip. Awesome sightseeing and great nature walk over the green field. The most spectacular view is that sun over Ichamati River. From this island I have seen a really amazing view of Bangladesh and I fall in love with this place. And we stayed in Taki for 2 days and for your information you will not get any hotel or accommodation in the island. Dining also available in Taki. And price is really cheap. So, best timing to travel in day and you can travel throughout the year except rainy season. It is safe because you are going on day time and the local people are really helpful. We arranged a picnic, take a boat ride and also have a swim on the river. Really we had a great fun. I am planning to go again and I already recommend this place to all of my friends. Now I am telling to you all. Have fun and enjoy every moments of your life.",Machranga Dweep (Kingfisher Island)
"Sinhagad fort is situated in pune. It named as sinhagad after great warrior tanaji malusare died while war. It has huge historical importance. I went there in rainy season. At that time the scenery around there was visual treat for me. From top, we can see torna, rajgad, tung and other forts it is a great place for picnic. It is well maintained in comparison of other fort. best part of this fort is that we can also go by vehicles till last end so anyone can visit there without any problem.it is popular between tourist so its very crowded place. Late night stay is prohibited there so you want to see all points then have to come early in morning.if you are trek lover then you should visit this place. And if you are nature lover then you should visit this place in rainy season. After reaching at the top of fort there is hotel which serves you tasty food. There specialities are zunka bhakar, kanda bhaji and chatni.and if you want they serve sweet curd. The only thing which dispoints me is that its hygiene condition is very poor.",Sinhagad
"Machranga Dweep is mind blowing Picnic spot near Ichamati river . This is Only beautiful arena where you can come 24×7 for picnics / fun / exploring situated at Hasnabad . If you are coming here always try public Bus service I remember bus no ( 79 c) which arrives from shyamaBazar to hasnabad. Never Opt for motor boat that is huge risky . You will be surprise to know all the arrangements are made by the Local Panchayat Samiti . And This time there are a lot of improovements made by them . Now No dirt was there , Every street was having 2 dustbins minimum and it is quite impressive to see Guards near River Ichamati to control Water pollution. There are many Hotels in this area . Prefer Kundan Hotel if you are vegetaian .They provide  Excellent services and Price is very Genuine . Dont prefer Dharamshalas as their is so much Dirtiness . You are safe here untill under the Rules and regulations . But dont Prefer outing during Night . But overall this place is Good picnic spot .",Machranga Dweep (Kingfisher Island)

After 2 hours we reached at Machranga Dweep. The Machranga Dweep looked so beautiful. There were trees all around the dweep which shows the beauty of nature. The scene of sea from the dweep looked like an awesome scene. I can't describe the beauty of Machranga Dweep in words. We also enjoyed their boat riding also. The people of Machranga Dweep was also helpful. They speak very polite. I suggest you friends to visit Machranga Dweep one time. Thanks for reading my review.",Machranga Dweep (Kingfisher Island)
"SINHAGAD : - If you are in or around POONA, you must try to take a trip to the nearby Sinhagad Fort. I stay in Mumbai but whenever I and my friends had a bigbreak we always go there even alone I have visited the fort on numerous times. Hence I know it very well This fort is situated on a mountain, which offers us a excellent birds eye view from the top of it. It is situated about 28-29  kms from Pune the Poona city. People like to trek the fort.  To reach to the base of the Sinhagad fort from the city we can also board a local transport bus [Pune Municipal Transport ] which we can alight from Bajirao Road to the base of Sinhagad. Old enginnering structures of the fort are marvellous which reminds us the Glory fo the Maratha kingdom 3 centuries ago. Sinhagad was one of the most iportant and the strategic fort of the Maratha empire during Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj`s era. You will also get to see TV transmission Tower installed by the Government of Maharashtra in the vicinity Sinhagad fort. For foodies, one gets the chance to taste the rural food which is very delicious, which consists of  Onion Bhaji, buttermilk, bhaakri, Pithale and many variety. A trip to Sinhagad is highly recommended by me to all of you who lives for adventure. NOTE :- Bit dangerous road, Not much of shelter &  No toilet facilities available :- Thats what I call adventorous .",Sinhagad

Hi! Friends . This Machranga Dweep is situated 70Kms away from kolkata in between two rivers. I visited there just due to some of my friends request because one of my friend wants to capture birds and environment photographs. We hired a boat to reach on Dweep. From boat the reflection of environment is reflecting on clear water thats looking so beautiful.  After reaching there many people was gathering there and some living people guiding to go there places. There is lots of birds flying over and hearing their voices feel too good. At noon we thought to stay somewhere but there is no hotel and good food facilities. Thats disappointed but further we were enjoying the real beauty of nature.

"Hi, today I'm going to tell you something important about the city of destiny vizag - Visakhapatnam. Once it was one of the important port cities of the then British India and it continues to be one of the best port cities. Nobody knows the fact, that in world war 2, the Visakhapatnam coast was bombarded by the Japanese army. you are planning to spend your vocation then you should definitely checkout the beautiful Visakhapatnam city. First of all why should one visit Visakhapatnam: There are number of tourist spots in this city which one can enjoy, like, Thotlakonda, Kambhala konda forest, Araku valley, Kailash giri etc. To enjoy the long coats line with several beaches, like, Ramakrishna beach, Yarada beach,  Rushikonda beach which is famous for swimming and its clear water, Bhermili beach and Tenneti beach. You can enjoy the cool climate, sitting on the beach. You can enjoy with your family and kids at different parks like, Tenneti park, Kailash giri, Shivaji park and even you can go to Indira Gandhi zoo park where you can have the glimpse of wide variety of animals.

And even you can travel by AP Road transport corporation run buses if you wish to save money. Even you can travel by air also, as there is an airport here. And there are some problems too, after considering these you can plan for your trip to Visakhapatnam. They are: One tourist destination is very far from the other, which means you can't complete your tour to vizag within 1 or 2 days. Secondly, you have very less hotels to stay with good quality and maintenance. Most of the hotels are not that great and clean. You can't expect a local guide here who can help you in your travel. Basically it is known for its beaches, but if you think of swimming here, it would be a danger game for you, as the chances of drowning in the sea are high. Overall, if you are planning to enjoy your vacation with your family at a low budget. Then, you should visit Visakhapatnam city. I'm sure you can enjoy the beauty of Visakhapatnam. Thank you.",Visakhapatnam

"Viskhapatnam AKA vizag will always be one of my favorite city on the east cost . I have not lived here my entire life but I have been visiting this city almost every year since I was about 10 years old.  When I first visited this place it was barely developed . There were only residential areas mostly and a few movie theaters and shopping complexes . This was about 11 years ago.  But in the recent times I have seen it change a lot.  And I don't know where to start . Well let's start from the cleanliness first.  When I was kid I remember the roads were just like any other indian roads with potholes , broken patches here and there garbage every where .  But in the recent times the cleanliness has gone soo far . The government has really looked into the awareness among the people and today the roads in vizag city are the best to drive on .  There is hardly any garbage on the roads . Waste managment has been properly managed.  And also we have a lot of big industries and tourism companies looking into this place . Today you even have hotels like the park hyatt , novotel and the gateway hotel which are considered some of the best hotels in india . . And another major reason why I like this city is that this place is covered with high lush green mountains on three sides andthe bay of bengal on the other side.  And you stay in between all that . You never feel like you are living in urban jungle . There is always plenty of fresh air and a beautiful sea shore to look at .

"Since last couple of years I have been travelling like never before because of hectic business schedule. Recently, I happened to visit Visakhapatnam ( Vizag) and that turned out to be one of my personal best destination. Vizag is a very systematic, holds a very high degree of cleanliness, spectacular beach  views and a city of great mindset. Starting with security, Vizag has been one of The most secure city with least crime rate. Security has always been a priority of theirs for constant improvement. New techs and tools are introduced for better security purposes. If we talk about the local sightseeing, I would recommend Vizag to every category of people. Vizag has the cleanest beaches across the nation. You can hangout with your friends or family having a little gossip and at the same time can enjoy the gentle breeze and waves. Apart from that, Vizag also has a lot to offer like submarine museum, ports etc. Hotels and restaurants are also not so expensive as much as a tourism city could have been. You can easily find restaurants according to your appetite. The most and generous thing about Vizag's hotels and restaurants is that their customers handling services are very good. Man I would really really recommend Vizag and if I ever get time again I woild really go there. I love vizag.",Visakhapatnam

"Happy to pen down a review on the new year and happy to share my experience at Vizag with my wife n kid during the X-Mas weekend. About Vizag: Vizag or Visakhapatnam is a coastal city in northern part of AP and is the second largest city in AP. It was also known as Waltair which is defunct but one can still see it in Railway quarters boards. It is also known as the City Of Destiny. The city is surrounded by many hills of the Eastern Ghats. Since the city is situated on the coast, the humidity remains high throughout the year. Temperatures during May may go up to 40Deg+ and hence the best time to visit is in the winter(Nov-Jan). Telugu is the language spoken by most of the people. However, Hindi is widely understood. We reached Visakha at 2330Hrs on 24th Night and stayed at Hotel Krishna Towers at Railway new colony, very close to the railway station. The hotel was truly a class and I will write a review exclusively about that sooner.Key attractions of Vizag: 1.Ramakrishna Beach: On X-Mas day, we went out to the RK Beach which is some 5-6kms from the hotel. The beach had a small shore but tidy. It had small shops on its shore which sells shells. There are many shops on the main road which is hardly 100mts and many sea facing apartments too. A pretty good place to relax and that too on a winter evening where you hardly feel the heat. The shore is pretty rocky and the harbour is also near by. Saw a big ship leaving the harbour. On a whole we can relax for sometime at RK Beach(Picture attached) 2.Rishikonda Beach: There is another beach called as Rishikonda beach which is little far from RK beach. I was told that it is very scenic and clean. Missed it because of time factor :( 3.Kailasa Giri:This is the best spot in Vizag. It is a hill where one can get a beautiful view of the city and the Vizag coast. There are cable cars available here and the garden here is pretty beautiful. Not to be missed. 4.Simmachalam: There is a temple at Simmachalam. It is on a hill and there is road to drive up. It also has good trekking facility which takes 2 hours approximately. There is also a railway station at Simmachalam where a few trains stop. 5.Indira Gandhi Zoo: This is located onto your right when you travel from Vizag to Vizianagaram(a town some 50km away from Vizag). This is located outside of the city and has got good connectivity from and to Vizag. Can be reached by a cab or also by auto. For shoppers, this is a good place where you find good stuff at a reasonable price. I found a good bamboo chair for Rs.500(Negotiable) and was of pretty good quality. There are also good shopping centres like Big Bazaar, CMR which are located within the city. All these places have a very good connectivity by Buses. Really a good time pass. How to get there: 1.By Rail: Vizag has a pretty good connectivity from major cities. From Chennai it is approx 800km and many trains pass thro' Vizag. Coromandel Exp. which runs between Calcutta and Chennai halts at Vizag. There are trains to other major junctions like Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Mumbai and also to many parts in Northern part of India. 2.By Air:  There is an Airport in Vizag which is situated on the outskirts of the city. It has daily flights connecting Delhi, Bombay, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta. So travelling by air is absolutely a good choice. 3.By Bus: There are many buses which connect Vizag with Chennai, Vijayawada and also to Bangalore. But compared to train and flight, this is more tiring. Nevertheless, they are good. Staying there: Since its a tourist spot, you have many hotels right from budget to star. You get hotels almost in all parts of the city and accommodation is not be worried about. Summarizing, I feel that it would be a good holiday spot to rejuvenate yourself. Visakha- PICTURE PERFECT!! Cheers, Naren.",Visakhapatnam
"Such a beautiful city. no doubt, city of destiny we call. Nickname( Vizag) . what a city, in this city till now there are many hotels and restaurent.

"I want to share my personal experience about Visakhapatnam tourist place. This place is very popular and many tourists are coming for entertainment. This place accessibility is good and I like this place, I come here with my friends in last month. This place location is good and natural looking is very nice. this place is not any good natural local sightseeing near of this place. This place have long distance with developed area so no any many hotel near of this place and good transport links with other city and places. This place is natural place and spread in long area so security is not proper work in this place and disturb many time but maintenance is not good,",Visakhapatnam
"Dear friends, Last year I went to Vizag(Visakhapatnam) in my Andra tour. Hence I am happy to share my own experience about it. Vizag, is sistuated in North Andra & also a coastal town. Vizag is surrounded by mountains & Rocks. In vizag there is a big Shipping Yard. When I visited there totally I was wondered. I think its the biggest shipping Yard in India. Vizag is the Head-quarters of southern Coast Guard Force. Secondly, I went to Kailash giri is the view point. In there we can view entire city of Vizag & beautiful Coastal  Area. You must visit this place without fail. We stayed in a big hotel, they collected Rs.1500/- only for a day! Its very cheap when comparing to other cities. So we can get excellent Accomodayion. Vizag is the 100% safety city. Lot of CCTV installed in the city. This gives us full satisfaction. If you go to Andhra you must visit Vizag without fail.",Visakhapatnam
"Few months back I visited the Sri Lakshmi Narayani GoldenTemple in Vellore on my way from Tirupathi. It’s located in Sripuram in Thirumalaikkodi village, about 12 km from Vellore, Tamilnadu. It was built by Sri Sakthi Amma, head of the Sri Narayani Peedam. Sri Narayani Peedam, a private religious charitable organization, built the temple. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Narayani.The whole temple is built of gold and it is estimated to be around 600 crores. One and a half tone of gold has been used to design this temple. The temple is located in 100 acres site, surrounded by mountains and lush green scenic beauty. The temple, covering 55, 000 sq ft, has intricate carvings and sculptures in gold. Twelve layers of gold foils have been pasted on copper sheets carved with the designs of Gods and fixed on the walls. Except for the pathway, the entire structure has been made of gold and copper. The pathways were constructed in shape of a star and in the centre golden temple is located. One has to walk all the way through the star shaped walkway to see the temple and the goddess Narayani. Throughout the walkway there are quotes from Bhagavad-Gita, bible and Quran and photos of the Sakthi amma. His photos depict the charitable work he has done. .The temple’s pillars, roof, interior and exterior were very well designed with gold. About 400 goldsmiths and coppersmiths, including craftsmen from Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanam, have completed the architectural marvel in gold in six years. The approximate cost of the temple is Rs 600 crore.Surrounding the temple is a pond where people throw coins, currencies, bangles, debit card etc. Narayani Amma, the founder of the temple was born in 1976.From his childhood he was more inclined towards spiritual engagements. In 8th May 1992 he saw goddess in white clad, lotus seated, four armed Divine Mother totally filling the skies, signaling that the time was imminent for the declaration of his Divinity. So he went on to build this temple with help of NRI’s. I don’t think that this is a wise idea to waste this much amount of money and gold on temple. Anyway I don’t want to get into it deeply, if get time friends have a visit. Basically this temple is not for a god, it’s for a man called sakthi amma. He resides in the old temple, opposite to this golden temple. To meet him, we have to get permission from the people over there. It’s about 140 km from Chennai and 200 Km from Bangalore and easy to reach.",Sripuram

"I have visited there around 10 times because I was admitted in Christian medical college, vellore for so long. Spiritual place,  so beautiful and it will attract you from its amazing designed beauty and holiness. The temple is in  very huge space like thousand of acres. Sightseeing- You will get to see a huge temple, well designed, well crafted and once it look like it is made of real gold,  it shines in sun rays and look mismerising, you can't take camera,  mobile inside the temple. Hotels/Accomodation-The nearest railway station is Katpadi, it take 2 hours from chennai by train,  you will get lots lots of lodge and hotels in vellore in very reasonable price because in vellore there is christian medical college ( CMC)  and VIT ( vellore intitute of technology) , so lots of people visit vellore frequently. Safety- safety is 100% , I can say it because I live there around 1 years, local peoples are very honest and cops are also supportive ( if you have any issue)  but be aware of tourists.",Sripuram
Sripuram is famously known for  Swarna Devalayam(Golden Temple). When we went to the Tirupati also  want to visit Sripuram as well. It is 150 km far from Tirupati. We stayed in a hotel for one day. Hotel is good with reasonable price. Temple all over outside made with gold plated. At the night it looks very beautiful. Really its amazing temple. Temple is about Laxmi Devi. We feel very peaceful in the temple. Behind the temple I saw a Koneru. Temple surroundings everywhere checking points are there. It is full secured with policeman. Outside of the temple there is Goshala(cow farm). Here I found all handicapped cows. The golden temple giving shelter to these cows. We can donate some money here. And we went to Iskan Temple as well. Everyone know about Iskan  temples. We hear Hare Rama Hare Krishna slogans in the temple surroundings.   By entering into the Sripuram I feel peaceful. No noisy nothing.,Sripuram
"Hi, friends! recently I went to tour with my family to Tamilnadu. And one of my favorite places is Sri Puram. It is located in Tamilnadu, Vellore, Thirumalaikodi Village. At first, we went Thirupathi and us went to Sri Puram Mahalaxmi temple. It`s Vimanam and Ardha Mandapam is made up of a Gold coating. It was one of a number in large Temples. And we had a blessing from Goddess Mahalaxmi Narayani and had our day very very special. And Goddess Mahalaxmi Narayani was looking very very beautiful and spiritual. And usually, it is named a small Golden temple of the India. Really we should feel very proud of our ancestors that they made our India incredible. But I felt very happy over the place Sri Puram really friends it was a wonderful place that I have ever seen. I would like to suggest to visit this wonderful and spiritual Goddess Lord Sri Mahalaxmi Narayani Temple. ""a small Golden Temple of the India.",Sripuram
"We had been to Vellore on our bike from Bangalore on March friday. We were apprehensive that being TamilNadu it would be language problem but we were astonished to see the majority of people in Vellore being well-versed in Hindi and all were extremely co-operative and gave us correct directions to the temple and also did not make us feel like outsiders. Even the temple authorities had pleasant smiles on their faces. Regarding the temple, we entered at 3 pm and completed our free darshan by 5 pm. For special darshan of INR 100, it would take approx. 2 hours. While entering, we can reads positive thoughts written in Hindi, English, Telugu, Kannada & Tamil. The temple is made up of gold and is surrounded with water, on similar limes to Amritsar Golden Temple. The temple architecture also impresses you every bit and you cannot stop adoring the temple. Also, the positivity which the temple possesses is also worth mentioning. We felt a positive stream of blood flowing inside us on being there which carried it with us even after darshan. Really, a place worth visiting repeatedly. Our only concern is the cleanliness of toilets at the waiting area. Overall, a great experience and looking forward to visit the temple again.",Sripuram
Hi all I had share my own experience on visiting this sripuram called as golden temple for the past 5times above. Inside the temple we should go by leaving our slipper and mobile and camera like any electronic devices in front of the temple by buying the token for all and accessibility like hotels with rooms in medium cost and good food then ATM's petrol station and many temple relateded items like temple photo and swami narayani photos and all available in outside. It doesn't want to see any other local areas because while we visit the temple only buy the way of 5star way manner in that we may see many stores inside their itself colth store temple related gift items and many items are available in that way itself we go by and we may see full if green grass and full decorative manner with colour full flowers its good to see and nice place. The name of the temple belongs the hotel has running successfully and after we get dharisanam of Lord narayani we may direct to dinning hall to make our lunch its our own wish to eat or avoid it I will ate 5times lunch is very good then outside hotel is best and applicable with rooms also in less cost. It's full and full temple area so no fear about our saftey we may have full safe and best place.,Sripuram
Golden temple is popularly known as swarna devalayam. All around the temple is covered with gold plate. Thete was a beautiful garden inside the temple. We need to walk a long distance which is in the shape of star for darshan. Maintainance of garden is good and it is very beautiful at night with colourful lights and water. We visited this temple on our tour to thiruthinni. The temple management is taking proper care in accomodating huge crowd. I recommend to visit atleast once.,Sripuram
"I visited with my family to sripuram / tamilan tirupathi .it is situated at vellore district.traveling time from vellore to sripuram is 35minutes.calm and good location.at that time lot of devotees was standing at general queue.so we had a choice to complete darshan and pooja quickly.i payed rs.250/-+ for for my family members.important one is, they not charged for kids under 10 year of age.after entered , they checked body and handbags.again tickets are verified by security.we walked 1 km with zig zag/star shaped path.saw lot of boards with slogans.after reached main sanctrum , I sat infront of lakshmi narayani diety.saw diety .it was very small insize compared with photo frame of guru/founder of the temple.it was irritated to me.afterthat we came outside from there.on the way many people sitting and asking money  for donation in the name of charity.i was really shocked  and understood the whole system of the temple.there was just making money using religion.it was very bad experience to me.",Sripuram
"Hai friends, today I am going to share my experience on  2 day visit of sri narayani temple(golden temple) which is located in vellore, TamilNadu. Sripuram spiritual park is situated at the foot of a small range green hills at Thirumalaikodi village, it is located at 8 km from vellore Tamilnadu. The temple is glided with pure gold. The salient features of Sripuram is the Lakshmi Narayani temple whose Vimanam and artha mandapam is covered with pure gold, housing the deity Sri Lakshmi Narayani. The temple was located on 100 acres of land and has been constructed by vellore based charitable trust. Temple with its gold covering has intricate work done by artisians specialising in temple art. Every single details in the temple art has significance from vedas. Sripuram's design features a star shaped path like sri chakra, positioned in the middle of lush green landscape, as on walks along with starpath to reach the temple in the middle, one can also read various spiritual messages - such as gift of the human birth itself, and the value of spiritually along way. Such a amazing place. in our life we can visit Atleast one time to sripuram and enjoy the spiritual power of goddess with nature. Thank you.",Sripuram
"I have visited many ashram(Sri Sri, Aurovile, Shri Aurobindo Ashram Pondy), Akshardham(Delhi etc). The Golden Temple at Vellore came across as a out right fraud to cheat people. They have made Tirupati like que's .pay Rs. 100 and you join the main que in between pay Rs. 500, you are closer etc. You will be in a caged que for atleast half the distance. Bathroom at available only at the end. The entrance etc. are shabby. You walk, and walk and walk(we had a Rs. 100 ticket). It was hard on my otherwise very fit 65 year old mom. The temple itself is a tiny structure.which any city would have literally tens or hundreds of. It has a nice smallish landscaped garden. If you have seen Akshardham Delhi, in terms of comparison of architecture, class, size: it would be 1%(yes, one hundredth) of it. Then as you come closer to the temple.you have to again go through a long 1.5? km star shaped corridor to get to it. Nopes .there is not short cut. I am not sure if the gold plates(which are 2 to 3 mm thick plates) are gold.I have my grave doubts. When we came out of the temple rows of staff behind computer screen were loudly seeking donations. The whole place reminded me of a shabby, money seeking exercise. There is a PR effort that Rs. 600cr has been spent. I don't think that even Rs. 5cr would have been spent on it.",Sripuram
"That the Golden temple at Vellore won a Green award made me interested to visit this place. The place right from the entrance turned out to be flocked with cheats and poorly organised setup taking thousands of people for a ride in the name of God! Minting money seems to be their motto. The board at the entrance prohibiting people from wearing cameras, cellphones, bermudas, etc did not mention the age criteria in the case of clothes. My child aged 10 who was wearing a three fourth loose fitting pants was stopped from entering saying the legs should be covered with a 'veshti'. The security guard himself was telling us where to buy this piece of cloth from. Looks like a full fledged nexus is in place! Found it funny as they were insistent on this dress for a child. A confirmation & argument at the PRO's office was the next thing on my agenda where I was 'permitted' to take my child into the temple after I threatened them that I would go to the Media :) I wanted to try out the 'free darshan' only as this was going to be my first visit. I believe that my reaction on this visit would be the basis to decide my future actions for my next visit. Though I was aware of the other ticket categories and also that if you had someone in there, you would be taken straight into the temple for a 'small' fee. The free darshan queue turned out to be a nightmare. Filthy, stinking of pee and urine. Just before we could be locked up in this stinking cage, I decided to escape from this dirty place :) Never try to visit this place. It is flocked by cheats & filthy people.",Sripuram
"It is a cleverly organized religious fraud trying to cash on Indian weakness for Gold and a cheap competition to Tirumala temple's fame. It all looks like an exhibition of wealth and people throng the place not for a spiritual experience but to pay and watch a glittering spectacle. And to add to it u have the godman 'Amma' (?!) who runs it ( I am sure he has a band of MBAs advising him how to spin money in the name of God) who has more publicity in the temple and in the town than the presiding deity.. It is a mockery of a temples' serenity and it is a large business empire spreading its tentacles in the lines of Kalki, Melmaruvathur and the likes.",Sripuram
Are you looking for peace? Do you want to reach to a place where nature gives you a tight hug? If your answer is YES .Then HAVELOCK is perfect destination for you.Its a marvelous place with  a panoramic view of the sea . Its just a natural swimming pool.Where water is so transparent that you can see each and every coral beneath the sea.The blue sea is so mesmerizing. But as of others I will not suggest you to do scuba diving here because its better in Jolly Buoy.Its better to make a pre-booking. HOPE YOU LIKE MY REVIEW!,Havelock Island

"I good place. It was clean and the weather was very nice but very unpredictable. It ccan change very quickly and make your ruin a day or two of your trip. For vegetarians the food can be a problem but for non vegetarian , the sea food is good. Communication can be a little problem too . The Beaches are clean and not so populated. When I arrived at the beach the weather was amazing. The weather matters. If you don't come at the beach  when the weather is good. It sucks. You will not enjoy it. There are only beaches you can go to in Havelock . And you can go scuba diving too. The coral there is good.",Havelock Island

Its a good place to travel with your partner. You can easily rent a scooty there and explore the island in two to three days. There are many hotels there but they are pretty expensive so better fill yoyr pockets before goong there. You can also experience scuba diving as there are many scuba diving centres there, minimal cost of scuba diving is around 3500 rs per person but its a must to try adventure sport.",Havelock Island

Havelock is a beautiful island and specially Radha Nagar beach. Best in Asia. U can spent hours playing with the water and just watching them. I stayed in Dolphin resort there and would strongly recommend to stay there. It has access to Vijay Nagar beach. People there are helpful. While planning a holiday to Havelock high temperature should be kept in mind. Also the day ends early there. Everything starts shutting off after sunset. So plan your day accordingly.,Havelock Island
"Havelock islands is one of the islands of Andaman which is worth the vist if you visit Andaman, Havelock is accessible from Port Blair through the huge speed boat, it takes approximately 2 hours to reach Havelock. The roads give a feel of the rural India, but the Elephant Beach and Radhanagar Beach give a feel of some foreign beaches as there are equal number of foreign tourists visiting this place. Havelock also has some good resorts, a night halt here is recommended.",Havelock Island
Havelock Island is the most attractive and beautiful island to visits. It is the most tourist attracting place that is visited by the tourists. The island seems to be very good and peaceful with clean and transparent water. The accessibility to the island is through waterways only it almost took 5-6 hrs. to reach to the island. It has good local sightseeing you can discover the island through bicycle or motorbike which you can take on lease that's the very good option you can ride on the island in good climatic conditions. Hotels/accommodations are less as they are limited but very good to stay there. safety is none of the factor on the island. One must spend his or her holiday at the beach with his families.,Havelock Island
"Visited havelock island this week and this place is really strange. Post of the people there are bengali and tamilians. Booked a hotel 2 mins walking from the jetty point. When I landed to havelock via the ferry, it felt like a nice place with beautiful sea, but as the time progresssed and I started exploring the place I found it boring. I had a 2 days stay there and trust me the time passes really very slow. It feels like a minute is of one and a half minute. There are not much places to visit except Radhanagar Beach which was the only placed I liked during my visit. Now coming to the food, I was expecting a lot of sea food to be there but the reality was far away from this. There was no fish or crab available at this time and also the food wasn't tasty and rather expensive. If you want to have some food in the lunch after 3 then it's a problem. My verdict: The place in terms of accessibility is not good, the mobile signals don't come. You'll feel disconnected from the world.",Havelock Island

"Hello friends, I want to share my personal experience about Havelock Island Tourist place. This place is very popular and many tourists are coming for entertainment. This place accessibility is good and I like this place, I come here with my friends in last month. This place is very attractive and enjoyful and good for summer holidays. This place location is good and natural looking is very nice. This place is not any good natural local sightseeing near of this place. This place have long distance with developed area so no any many hotel near of this place and good transport links with other city and places. This place have many transport service for going other places. This place is natural place and spread in long area so security is not proper work in this place and disturb many time but maintenance is not good. This place is good for holidays but not for a long time. Thanks.",Havelock Island

"To be very honest agra if not at all a good place people over there only tries to cheat you in any means, I was at railway station, hired a rikshaw instead of my suggestions he forcefully took me to a random hotel as he was getting commission from there, and after that I changed the hotel but the new hotel was even worse every thing was so over priced even the water bottle was selling was above MRP and I asked him the reason he said 20 rs for fridge charge. food over there is pathetic as well, I tried dal for 200rs and it was whole water, its over crowded and place where goons are ruling there are not afraid of police . only because of taj you cannot compare the whole city, for example just 200metres away from the taj you can see the slums and beggars, so for me agra was pathetic except taj mahal",Agra
Friends beware.the only wine shop in havelock has been shut down this season. So u due advantages are being taken by the bars located in resorts . they r charging huge huge amount rs.300 for a pint of premium beer and 400 for 30 ml whiskey.in fact the beautiful beaches can't be enjoyed without some beer or drinks.so consult your travel agent and carry liquor from port blair itself. Also buying liquor from port blair itself is not a piece of cake. There are 4-5 Govt regulated liquor vendors in port blair and they only accept cards for payment. There r always 100 people standing in que in front of the vends.so bette carry liquor from the place u r goin(one can carry 5 ltr of liquor in domestic flight checking baggage.,Havelock Island
We went on a trip to Agra from Delhi . special purpose we went there is to visit Taj Mahal. The most ridiculous thing happened to us on their is the line for entrance Taj Mahal was so big decided to leave and come next day earlier in morning but then a person came to us and approach you want to visit Taj Mahal within 20 minutes and I don’t know why we agreed on this he asked for Rs.500 for each person including children’s and we gave to him just to visit Taj Mahal and that guy take us to the another entrance gate where line is not as big as we seen in front Gate. That guy just cheated us and rain away after we reach the second entrance.,Agra

"When it should have been India's top tier city, Agra is a city that sucks in every manner! I'd be really brief here as there's too much to say about it. The historical places aren't very well managed and preserved. When you go visit Fatehpur sikri, etc be ready for filth and garbage everywhere! There's people throwing rubbish all over the place and monuments are getting encroached upon badly! People rob you in the name of tourism. Especially the guides are the worst. They charge you high fees and don't even know about half the things they are talking about! Don't get misled by these cheaters. The city is suffering from horrendous garbage management issues. The municipal work is non-existent. You get the typical filthy smell of Agra the moment you enter the city. The water here tastes disgusting! There's no major airport here. And this is supposed to be a famous tourist place! There are no good Malls and shopping complexes in Agra. Every store is worth a 3rd tier city. Nothing worth buying. You can skip any shopping here. Only okayish place is Sadar where you can have some street food and snacks. I found this again, nothing too noteworthy! Overall, Agra has been forever neglected city by the state government. I wish people would have given more attention to this place considering it has Tajmahal and most foreigners come to India only to visit Agra! Very sad state of the city. It needs a complete overhaul!",Agra
"Agra is well known city of india. It is very historical city and there are various story and monuments in agra. Agra is situated in UP and it is very near to capital New delhi. So the accessibilty to agra is very good.  You can reach agra by air , by train and also by road. It is the main railways route of central india so therw are many trains. There are various local sights but The main attraction of agra is THE TAZ. Tajmahal is one of the wonder out of 7 wonders. Sikandara is also very famous place to visit. Local garden near taz at the river yamuna is very atttactive and peaceful.the agra fort is also visting place in the city. In agra there are many hotels/accomodation as per as visiter demand. There are various hotels that are 5 star where visiters can feel comfortable amd also some cheap hotels and lodge where medium budget people stay. In the term of safety, agra is safe place the locals of agra arw sweet and talk very respectively. And there are many police stations as well as polices are avaiable at every market, traffic points and all visting places. According to me people should visit the agra and seen the historical places.so feel free about safety and reaching problem. You will not face any issue.",Agra
"Hello guys, Agra is known for Taj Mahal but nobody knows what else other than Taj Mahal could be related to Agra. I will try to answer that with my review.Agra had many hotels as it is one of the most sought after city for tourist from worldwide. But most hotels are overpriced for the quality they possess. I got a room for 1500₹ a night and it was no better than cheap 500₹ a night kind of hotel in any other less hyped city.I went to Taj Mahal and it was god damn beautiful. It is much astonishing beauty that takes you by surprise even though you already know and expect it to be beautiful. Still, it is beyond any expectation because there is nothing as beautiful and extravagant as Taj. If talking about the city, there are few other places as well such as Agra fort and few other Mughal heritage sites. But everything else is nowhere closer to admiration after viewing Taj ahead of them. I would advice to visit the Taj Mahal in the end to keep yourself involved in other places. I did the mistake and I was unable to accept any other place of any good since I saw the Taj before in the day.But I have given the city a dislije for very strong and well intented reason. Agra is very poorly organized and any random place is being used for dumping household waste in the city.Upon having a walk near around my hotel which was apparently close to the Agra Fort, I was disappointed to see the filthy and unorganized nature of city. The roads were full of potholes and the drainage system was horrible. A very unpleasant smell was extemporarily annoying me to an extent that I had to keep my hankerchief over my nose. The sewerage lines are open and asymmetrical. Add to it, the blockages on regular intervals which was making it spread all over the road at random. I have to admit there were more than 5 such incidences in between the 2 kms of walking distance after which I returned back to take some fresh air. Literally, Agra is one of the most polluted and dirty cities which I have ever seen and I say this in spite of the fact that I have been to Kanpur too.About the people over there, I will just share this incident. I reached Agra by bus. The journey in summer season is pathetic even if you travel with AC buses and much worst if the AC goes corrupt which happened with my bus. As soon as you get out of the bus at the final stop, there will be numerous auto drivers pulling you physically as if you are their friend. Two of them started pulling my either hand and before I could react to their protuting behaviour, theywere already fighting for the rightful one to have first approached me. I shrugged both of them to move further and take my time to plan what to do next. But as I stepped across them, there were innumerable other Auto drivers ready to catch me. It was terrible to get out of those crooked drivers. They were asking for unreasonably higher prices and every person had one hotel to recommend which according to them, was the cheapest and best. I had to call one of my friends lived in Agra then, and he helped me out with the hotel and all other things. No local man was interested to help, either due to the fear of those auto driver's union whom I bashed verbally or may be they saw no profit in helping me. The place was not friendly at all.",Agra
I Had Visited agra with my friend and brother six months ago this place offers you the different natural beauties and monuments but the thing Makes  Agra so Special is The Tajmahal as all of you already know that its the symbol of love but its more beautiful in its own. Everybody have to visit there atleast once. Expense- The Overall Touring packages are really cheap and the Food is also in budget. The Local taxi association offers you 6hrs sightseens for only 800 Inr and 4 hrs sightseens in 500inr only. So we Can say the Travelling expense is overall under budget. Sightseens- There Are Major Five kind of Sights available there to see.   1. Tajmahal.  2. Redfort.  3. Mehetab bag.  4. Local sweet market( petha speciality) 5. Mini structure of tajmahal for night view Agra offers u decent amout of space and peace. Its is an ideal weekend tourist place for family and friend. Thank you,Agra
Agra is the very old city of india very popular city of india in other words many people's says that mughal city because 800 year mughal emperor kingdom was there in agra and one of the most beautiful things are located in that city TAJ MAHAL the seven wonder of the world one is our taj mahal in my experience I am saying that Taj mahal is very very beautiful to see when u see continuously you can't able to blink your eyes just think how much the taj mahal is beautiful I go last year only agra and I am very happy and excited to visit taj mahal and I finally visit and see.,Agra
"I Went agra many and many times.every time I went to agra, I went from New delhi because I visited with my family and laws who resides in delhi.There are a multiple accessibility to access this city.Basically Agra is known for it's historical identity. ""The Taj mahal"",the 7th wonders in the world is the prime attraction of the city.during the mughal empire, the fifth mughal emperor saha jahan built this dedicating to his wife Mumtaj. The Taj mahal is spectacular guys still today.I recommend every people to visit Taj mahal even for a single time in their lifetime.This is the beauty about agra.This is the city of Historical Monuments, so, Apart from the Tajmahal, You can visit Agra fort, Jama masjid, Fatehpur sikhri, Dewani-khas, Bullan darwaja, Akbar's tomb, Mariama's tomb, keetham lake and many more. So these were the positive sides of agra. But it has some negative sides also, Like As This city is so much populated, so you will find the roads, the railway track, and the other side of the city much dirty.you will have local transportation system available normally but most of the times these are so much crowded during the day.this is one of the crowded place.And you will find a lot of dirtyness all over it.One more thing that you need to be alert about, As this is one of the very common tourists place in India, So people over here are always ready to make benefit from you.You will have a variety of foods place here according to your budget.There are quality restorants and the Middle-class food shops are available both.But, I recommend strictly to not have street food here. Overall, I recommend people to visit agra and feel the magic of beautiness of there.It's indeed a place to visit. Thanks",Agra
"We have been to Port Blair(Andmaan &Nicobar Islands) from 14-Jan-12 to 19-Jan-12 and as I thought it was / will be an unforgettable journey for  us. We 30 ladies of group of friends went to Andaman trip. It was amazing experience. After staying for 2 days in Port Blair we went on a stay for 3 days to Havelock Islands which is about 2 hours cruise ride from Port Blair and we stayed in a resort called Symphony Palms. Another lifetime unforgettable experience that we had at Havelock island. Staying in a wooden cottage just next to sea is all I can ask for where we actually got a sense of pure leisure. It's a great place to visit, blue sea and peace are the USP of this island. Radhanagar beach is a real beauty. the beach is so clean that you can't find such beaches anywhere in India that's for sure. we had a very good time at Port Blair, Havelock island and Neil Island. there are three ways to reach havelock island - govt. ferry, private Makruzz or Sea Plane. The days are mostly sunny at this time of year, and the sea sometimes flat enough to reflect the clouds. The monsoon usually hits around late May, lasting until the end of July, and is probably the worst time to visit the island – strong winds, frequent rain and low visibility underwater. Radhanagar Beach(Beach #7) is the most beautiful on the island and was rated as the best in Asia by provides welcome shade looks out over turquoise water, some stretches with a sandy bottom good for swimming and some with excellent coral reefs that are great for snorkelling – a great combination indeed. Sunsets here are often spectacular and it's a popular time to be at the beach, but be careful not to miss the last trucks back if you're not staying here. Havelock also has some good resorts, a night halt here is recommended.",Havelock Island
"I rarely write negative reviews. I am the glass is half-full type of positive, bubbly happy-go-lucky person. But somethings make you so frustrated that you want to scream your lungs out. My trip to Agra and the Taj Mahal was one such experience. Go on, read more. So in Dec. last year, a very good friend and I decided to visit Agra together. When he agreed, my excitement and anticipation level went up. It was a dream come true but for what? Agra is POORLY connected with the rest of india. The airport there hardly has any flights and the only option for international travelers is the often bumpy and rough ride which kills you, from Delhi by road. The last 5 miles in Agra to reach the Taj Mahal is a maze through slums, shanty towns and congested streets. When you finally reach the taj complex, you're greeted by filth, animal excreta stench and ""tourist guides"" ready to take you for a literal ride. Getting inside the Taj is a nightmarish experience and if you reach on a holiday or a Sunday, God will bless you for your patience. The security guys are polite but almost behave like they want to insult you for anything that they can find on you. The Taj is an over hyped monument whose fame is like the Emperor who has no clothes. No genuine restrooms, no recreation facility no restaurant. The area in and around teh Taj can be compared to the lack of infrastructure in the Sahra deserts of Africa. Besides 2-3 ""five"" star hotels in Agra, there's hardly any middle-class decent accommodation. I am middle class and I cannot afford to pay Rs. 10, 000 a night at the Taj. Am I to suffer because I am not rich? My advice: Don't visit the Taj if you are not a big fan of architecture. Avoid Agra like plague. And please write, email, call the various governments to clean Agra, build better road and provide better tourist infrastructure. Will love your comments and do check my new profile page. My only positive point from the whole journey was I got to spend some time with my friend. Kaajal",Agra
"I was travel in agra two times first it was october 2016 and second was march 2018 but I want to travel to agra more and more and more agra is very beautiful and safe city of middle of the India here is a large number of historical palace to travel in any season agra is also known for city of taj mahal taj mahal is seventh miracle of world but not only taj mahal here are a large number of beautiful and historical palace - lal qila , jawahar bagh and many more and the people of agra is very helpful and mostly honest agra is also well known for its very tasty foods and I eat here my lifes most tasty and delicious dishesh and its located in near delhi so you can find many trains in twenty four hours agra is fullfill with beautiful nature and when you come here then dont be miss the famous of here it is very testy and good for health i am very happy to share my experience of agra city and invite every one to visit this city",Agra
"I had lot of expectations, have visited Agra 2 weeks back. Taj Mahal looks good, but not as much as the hype created by someone, also everywhere starting from Cab drivers in Agra Canteen railway station(they threaten, fight each other etc Shopping centers(no proper bill with GST etc), many shops they say they are run by UP Govt, but please google and check with UP Govt helpline if you really want to shop) Many small hotels, even sweet shops who sell Petha(there is no expiry date, MRP etc and no fixed price and if you are good in bargaining, you get better price, even for food, sweets? Yes! Except big shops and in airport, they provide proper bill and the sweets quality is good I felt that the intention is to loot/cheat the tourists and earn money as much as possible which is pathetic. 5.Hygiene around Agra - again pathetic It's known the tourist spots are like this, but this is the first time I had very bad experience. Also, be careful of anything you buy from street shoppers near Agra, even Delhi because they quote 10-12 times price (Example. Taj stone toys, they will say INR 400, if you bargain well, you may get for 50 bucks! I am serious. Pretty much, same scenario near India Gate, Delhi also, but not as bad as Agra. Hope this review may help someone, also if someone from Govt reads, they may do something about it?",Agra
"The Tuljabhavani Temple is a very old temple from the times of Sri Rama. Shivaji the great ruler, was a great devotee of the diety here, and would always take her blessings before going out for any wars. This temple is having a jagrut deity, that means one can feal the vibrations of the diety if one is pure and close to divinity. There is a power which can heal or give solace to any problem. When Rama was on his search for Sita, on her abduction by Ravana, he had stood here and asked for directions. It was then that the goddess appeared and showed him the way. When she appeared, He had said 'Tu Ka Aie'. Meaning Is ist You Mother. Tu Ka Aie became Tulja and mother became bhavani. There is stone here which sugests that ur worry will be resolved or not. One has to keep one's hand over it. If the stone moves to the right, work shall be done,  if it moves to left, the answer is no. This stone has a scientific principle and it works on the basis of one's subconscious state of mind, feeling the positive or negative vibrations from a person.  One should surely try it. This diety is a kuldevi or family diety of many people in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and AP. Blessed are the souls who have her grace, do visit it once and get grace showered on you. The divine will will help you rech there, and garness her blessings.",Tuljapur

"Hi, Today's topic is Agra. Friends as we all know that Agra is famous for Taj Mahal. Yeah, I travel to Agra for a visit of Taj Mahal. That was my first time to visit Taj Mahal. Agra is very nice place and Taj Mahal is very beautiful palace. I travel with my friends and we rest in hotel delux plaza. That hotel was awesome. Yeah I enjoyed very much. Agar is a safe place to survive. I did not want to leave agra but the happiness is always in the house. Aftet 6 days of tour I came back to my home sweet home. Thanks.",Agra
"Last week I visited agra as a part of faculty tour. Few things which I noticed very common over there was people looting the tourists, doesn't matter whether its indian tourist or forrigners. They ask for thrice or four times and even more price if they see some new tourists. It was te case not only at tajmahal only but also at public places like railway station, bus stands etc. Second thing is that the city is very much polluted. I still remember when we were in train and asking each other how much time would it take to reach agra. Then one of us told that the moment when you will be unable to breathe without keeping a hanky on your mouth, understand its AGRA. And the same happened. Of course the tajmahal was best. We captured good memories. The sweets like pethas were awesome but what remained in our memory is the dirtiness over the city and people looting the tourists.",Agra
"I went to Delhi for a wrestling national level competition. After my wrestling mach, I wish to travel all the places near to Delhi. From there first I gone to Agra redfort. It was soo beautiful and excited me. Redfort now also looking like a place. Some of the areas are restricted to us. We can walk around the redfort through the alloted area. After visiting redfort, I travelled to see Thajmahal. I seen Thajmahal on in videos and pictures before I reach there. I don't know how to explain the beauty of Thajmahal. The construction and the materials used to build Thajmahal made me to think about to legendary people lived in that period. If anybody wish to see Thajmahal, don't wait. Go as early as possible. You never disappoint about the travel. I am soo happy to see Thajmahal.",Agra
"Tuljapur is very much popular temple in  Maharastra, though it is not very much well known  as Shirdi for example. I did not know about this temple about two years ago until my driver suggested that we must go via Tuljapur to Shirdi. At that  point I said yes to him but did not ask much . He explained that  it was chatrapti Shivaji's  ""ila velpu""  meaning  the goddess he worshiped. And finally when we were going to Shirdi , we skipped the route  to Tuljapur , because somebody we asked on the way told that  Shirdi via  Sholapur is better , and  the  road via Tuljapur was bad .  I did not care and told the driver to go straight to  Sholapur. I convinced myself that I did not make promises to go Tuljapur and I did not break it either, But the Goddess seems to have got  angry , and she punished me . At  Sholapur chowrasta , the corrupt police harassed me for one  hour in hot summer  and collected 300 rupees ""mamool""  bribe from me on some flimsy reason that  there is no pollution certificate , it was my new  car and I did not  take pollution certificate . That one year period was over by just one week they argued and said I should pay one thousand rupees fine, Later I learnt that  sholapur  police are experts in harassing Shrdi going piligrims and it was very common for the sholapur police to loot the piligrims. All this happened I thought was because in the last minute , I canceled my plan to visit  Tuljapur. After two years when in November,2007 , I was driving my car myself , I did  visit Tulajapur Bhavani mandir.  It was on Hyderabad to  Bombay  highway , you will  see  a very big Board by R&B department indicating , that  a right turn at the ""Y""  junction takes you to Tuljapur. If you were going  to  Shirdi  from  Hyderabad , you need not come back  to  this ""Y"" junction again  to go to Sholapur and from there to Shridi. You can continue your journey from Tuljapur  to Shirdi. The road up to Tuljapur is really very good. But from  Tuljapur to Shirdi , only some  parts of the road  is terribly bad  so  much so that you would  think your car  shock absorbers ,even axle rod would be broken. But  this road is presently under repair on a big scale. This time  November second week  when I visited  Tuljapur , what I expected and what I saw was very different. It was a huge temple  ""gopuram""  the main entrance that attracts you.  It was really a huge construction. Inside as in many temples all is in quandary. touts harass devotees ,perticularly the first timers at will. They misguide you telling that they would take you closest to the deity , and  normal  darshan in the queue would be quite a  distance from the main deity,.They asked us Rs.300/  and rhen someone asked only 150 or some amount like that. Yet another one explained that you would give that amount as donation  to the temple and take a receipt as well. The people  in the queue advised us to stay in the queue and the darshan of the deity would be just the same. We stayed in the queue and really darshan of the main deity Goddess Durga Bhavani , is just the same. The distance is almost similar for those who paid to the touts and to us. Like monkeys  the touts swing on the queue shed iron rails and jump up and walk on the rails to come out of the queue line , and again probably try to attract some other devotees. There is a very big courtyard , once you cross this huge main entrance gopuram. On the right side , if you choose to go , you would walk through water flowing in a stone room and come out of it. After visiting Ganesh , You would walk through another entrance and in to a very huge courtyard with neem tree. You will see  many villagers,newly married couples as devotees. The actual sanctum  is a small temple. The main idol is very attractive . you will not forget  Tuljapur Durga Bhavani, again in your life time, Priests behave very well. Even with that much rush, you can see Goddesss Durga for much time as you would be coming out in a direction which facilitates to see her all along while coming out.  ""Durga "" , you would  feel her presence. There is something very spiritual about this temple, I thought  to myself while coming out. The priests put sindur on my forehead very wide. I did not any see any stone where devotees feel vibration etc., as described in other reviews.",Tuljapur

"First of all always go to manali in a volvo bus dont take normal bus otherwise you will go vomitting second thing always take extra clothes extra shoes and extra undergarments with you and if possible a rain coat as well. on reaching manali you will get lot of people trying to rent there hotels but dont go with them. it is very good if you have prebooked your hotel. if you want to live in a standard hotel it will go approx 500-600₹ per room in which atmost 3 people can live. there are 5 star hotels as well. Few things you should consider one of them is bargaining if you are good at bargaining then you will know how items are overpriced here people always try to sell there items at 3 times the price so it is better to be prepared few places you should visit is gulaba, solang valley, kasol, manikaran, kullu river rafting and paragliding, jugni waterfall, hadimba temple, vashisht temple etc you can do paragliding in 1000₹ but people there will ask for more than 2500₹ see the overpricing here so again I must say bargain. one of the things you must do is rent bullet and go for a bike ride. you can go to solang valley or kasol with bullet it will cost you 1000₹ per bullet and petrol charger extra but the trip will be worth it. and at manikaran temple you can bath at warm pool which is ver famous you can rent taxi for there. at last I must say it will be a lifetime experience. go for it",Manali

Manal is a beautiful hill station in himachal pradesh.  I went to manali with my college friends. It was really a fun.  First off all the mall road was nearby to the bus stop.  And you can find accomodation and dining facilities nerby.  We had no difficulties  in finding the hotels . Location is on a hill top and you can see mountains nearby. ROHTANG BYPASS is a wonderfull place to visit in manali. Is is closed fpr the most of the season due to heavy snow fall. LOCAL SIGHTSEEING : the local temple is a must visit.  Or you can go for the river rafting. Natural beauty is at best there. CONNECTIVITY : IT is connected to kullu by well maintained  roads. U can find some dums in holes due to land slide and construction work.  U can get busses easily to manali from CHANDIGARH.  If you want to hire a cab.  That is also available. SAFETY. : it safe in the morning but in the night it gets little riskey for women due to unavailability of police or other staff.,Manali
"I have visited manali last year in January starting . I had visited it in winter because I wanted to see snowfall there but can't able to see. We found snow in manali by luck not by season sometime in summer snow is falling but sometime in winter also snow not fall. Manali is awesome place to visit in the vacation . We can do Various activities like paragliding, river rafting, river crossing etc in manali and is snow is also present so activity related to snow can also we can do . Manali is the place where all ages of person can enjoy and we can also go with our family also . From my opinion best time to visit Manali is during summer vacation because we can get relief of summer also and can enjoy maximum activity at that time . We can enjoy both kind of activities at that time both activity done in snow or don't done in snow . Activities done in snow can be done in Rhotang which is situated above manali and other activities in kullu- manali . Thank you",Manali
"Hi All, Today I am going to share my travel experience of Manali.  This place situated in Himachal Pradesh(India).  I heard a lot about the beauty of this place for years and trust me it was not disappointing at all. I am basically from Deccan area which Hyderabad, so it is naturally fascinating for people like me when they visit such place in Himalayan range. Manali has got all the tourist attractions for individuals, couples, families and also aged.  Hotels in all budgets, different types of foods, comfortable local travel more importantly local people are very welcoming in nature. On third day I have visited Rohtang Pass which was once the highest motor-able place in the world.  Just to make us more thrilling the moment we went there snow fall started.  This is the first time in my life that I have seen and touched snow,  Me and my family thrilled to be there.  Adding to it we had hot tea at the same place just imagine how wonderful it was.  For visiting this place online permit has to be taken one day before.  But trust me  it is worth going.  Hope you all will go and enjoy this place.  Refer to any popular travel sites to know the correct time of visiting Manali. Bye for now.",Manali
"Manali is tha famouse place of india for all the tourist .recently I visit this beautiful city. In my whole life I dont seen this type of amazing place.if u want to go this place please visit this place in november to march of every year. At that time you found that snow fall . In this beautiful city we should visit solang velly, hidimba devi temple, tibbati place, 1947 cafe, the rock bar and lounge etc Accourding to my view please enjoy the adventure with snow like river rafting, paragliding, sketing and many other thing.please enjoy it thanx",Manali
Beautiful no doubt. But very much over crowded. Hotel rate is thrice or even more. Local sight seeing like solang trip takes a lot money. Too much traffic to rohtang pass. Mall road is thickly crowded. Every hawkers and most of the shop keepers loot customer. Although no problem of security. In nutshell not  at all value of money.,Manali
"Having planned days in advance from Mumbai for a Vacation for family and my parents to get a break from the routine and spend quality time together, we hired an Innova from Chandigarh to drive us for 2D/3N at Manali (Hotel Honeymoon Inn,Aleo)and then 2D/3N at Dalhousie(Alps Spa Resort,Dalhousie), also we spent a nite enroute at Dharamshala(Pong View Hotel, Dharamshala).One of the best decisions I have or we have made in our lives till date that has not been discarded...enjoyable trip, good accomodation, beautiful weather, delicious food, wonderful vehicle choice and driver(Anil) to cart the 5 of us(Includes wifey,daughter,parents and me of course).. Enchanting views, breathtaking scenic pleasures,Snow clad Rohtang,Mythical Hidimba Temple,Lots of Himachali Wines(flavored),treat of hospitality all over, lovely crowds, good shopping... I specially mention the Hotels above, since these were the best in terms of Service, Food, Hospitality, Cleanliness,and above all comfortable since they all gave us large rooms(2 DBLs) and they were all done up(refurbished) very recently as it seemed.... My Trip began on 25th May @ 0600 from Chandigarh and I presume and recommend this to be a very good time to be in these Hill Stations. Manali has lots of snow and mild rains, Rohtang is pristine still, paragliding is a hot adventure sport option and so is white water rafting; Dharamshala & Pong Valley are lush with fresh pines and green acorns, Mcleodganj and Dalai Lamas Monastery is religiously beautiful and Dalhousie with its winding roads is so poerfectly wonderful and that little 22 km drive to Khajjiar,simply WOW !!! Do not miss it for anything in the world... All In All, Keep Manali (Kullu)- Dharamshala (Mcleodganj-)Dalhousie on your Itineraries next vacation but TIP : If you plan to drive from Chandigarh, start as early as 0500 and also keep 3N/4D at Manali (Rohtang, Manikaran:Sulphur Hot springs,Naggar castle and Dr Roerichs Art Gallery) -for a wonderful time and then 1N/ for Dharamshala and 2N/3D for Dalhousie(Include Chamba, Khajjiar, and just chillout 1 night in the restaurants(shacks) in the town with hordes of foreigners who teach you the way to actually relax and enjoy life... Keep posting your reviews after you have done this trip or others who managed to do this earlier for the benefit of others Mouthshutters...",Manali
There are some common destinations in INDIA for tourism which are well-known. One of them is MANALI. A place where the major tourism is in summer. When people are frustrated with the increasing heat of the  summer they usually prefer a cool location. And manali comes to the mind first. I also been there for the chilling effect in this summer but my experience was horrible. No because the place is bad but there are other reasons. First of all the accessibility: I will say don't think of going to Manali for next 2-3 years as there is major work going on to build the wider roads that your average speed is not more than 20-30 kms max. So we took almost 14 hours to reach to the destination from Chandigarh. In comparision to that simla seems better option. The traficc was so high that every few kms you have a stay of 20-30 minutes. So the travelling was a nightmare for us. And it seemed that the work will continue for next 2-3 years and they have no provisions for the running traffic. Local sightseeing: The same thing occured while we were going for local sight seeing. The hidimba temple was just 3 kms away but in taxi it may take 2-3 hours and you have to go by walk. which take 45 mintues. same way the most famous place Rohtang Pass: to reach there we started in the morning 4 am and reached around 3 pm. and after staying there for 1 hour again we came back around 10 pm in night. so for 1 hour of snow views we travelled for more than 15 hours. Which was too much for me. the distance is just 45 kms. but the traffic was so heavy. I would have prefered a lonely place instead of that or staing in my hotel. So you can make out the conditions for sight seeing. you just keep on crashing with the others. The only thing I enjoyed was River rafting which was short but sweet and had fun. but it also had major traffic issues. Hotels and accomodation: There are lots and lots of options available for accomodation and but I found the charges a bit higher in comparision to the quality of the hotels. It can be because of pick seasons.  The hotel staff was good though. Safety: the place is hight crowded and you have to keep yourself well aware about your belongings and your children. even the mall road was so crowded that I didn't feel to stay on a single shop for shopping. All an all don't go Manali until the road work is over and never in the pick season. otherwise has more crowd then the city I live in.,Manali
"Not an easy task because from my personal experience it takes up 12 to 13hrs to reach manali ( excluding 2 3 hrs for breakfast time or lunch time all) at first 5 , 6 hr u enjoy to drive but after that its get tiring towards the day end if you are a solo driver, not only driving but the road of the manali that was extremely dangerous even in some road there was not as much space that two cars can even cross that road together and when you enter in himachal that slopy areas if you don't have a strong stomach or you have any problem you can even womit in the car As the place you can't even think how beautifull it is there was so many place for sightseeing there was one special road one market where everything you can buy and was popularly known as mall road and also have so many places to visit the people was also so good and was very neat country you can't even throw your chips rapper outside strictness as well as cleanliness make manali a perfect place but to go their is not any easy task and if an rookie driver think that its an easy task to drive a car and he can drive to manali so let me clear that is not your cup of tea even an professional driver can't handle car in some slopy arears so my opinion is you must go to manali but not with car even if your are a profession driver you can go by plane to kullu then you can continue with bus to manali",Manali
I & my family have been in Manali for last 3 days. I am extremely disappointed with the infrastructure of this place. Roads are narrow & in terrible condition. There are traffic jams everywhere & one has to think not twice but many times before leaving hotel to visit any place as one is not sure when he would come back. Driving is literally impossible. The whole town is filled with smoke & smells of diesel. Going out would only mean tension & no relaxation. Even reaching Manali from place like Delhi is a herculean task as the road after Kartarpur is in a terrible shape. Please go anywhere on earth but don't come to Manali. It is hell on earth,Manali
"Me n my family were there in Manali between 1st to 4th June 2019. Due to NGT ruling for only 1300 vehicles permits to Rohtang Pass, I found lot of corruption at permit level and tourists were getting looted . Before NGT ruling, Innova fare for Rohtang Pass was INR 4000 which they are charging now INR 16000. Surprisingly, I found more than 5000 vehicles in Rohtang, instead of 1300. So, basically, there was no reduction in vehicles permit to Rohtang after NGT ruling but charges were almost quadrupled due to corruption in granting permit . It's better to look for some other place than Manali in summer due to such corrupt practices. I am highly disappointed with my trip and promise  never to visit manali again not recommend it to others.",Manali

The place that makes your soul out. Natural beauty at its best. Ooty temperature at mere 20 km from mukkam town Calicut. The place more colder on nights. It's a trecking spot. 8 km trecking needed to reach the hill top. There is many camps that setup anything means party or food. Although the place is cool enough the place is not that cool for lady members. It's my opinion because the shelter we have there is open. And it's too dangerous for women since there no one in this place except the camp owner and the workers. But if you got enough gents to take care of ladies with readymade camp shelters this place will be unforgettable. Buy all you needed before trecking since you will not  find a single shop at the top. If the accommodation facilities are good enough this place will be a new adventure trecking spot.,Kakkadampoyil

"Hello friends, This is one of the best place to visit in Kerala. In every season it's climate is cool even in summer it does not cross over 30C. This is a very best place to visit in monsoon season Kakkadampoyil is located in the forest area in Kozikode district in Kerala. Accessibility -  we can go to this place by train but very slow trains are there so it is amazing that we can enjoy the nature in the journey and Calicut international Airport is available. Local sightseeing - In western Ghats Kakkadampoyil is the border area so we can enjoy the mountain regions, hill stations and amazing Chaliyar River around this place. Hotels and accommodation - We have pre booked a resort to us and online bookings are available so nobody will suffer with the lodging an boarding. Thank you.",Kakkadampoyil

"Hello guys this is zeeshan shaikh and today I am here to review about baralikadu which is a very awasome place in the state of tamil nadu. Is can also be called as mother of nature. It is one of the natural place in india. You can enjoy the beauty of nature at baralikadu. We can also enjoy camping , bornfire, lakes, cold wheather etc. The travelling is bit far from mumbai but it is worth of its travelling. Travelling from mumbai to tamil nadu is also fun. If your riding on bike than it will be more than fun. It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen and so I suggest you to visit this place one day and hope my review is helpfull to you.

I still remember, we were under foothills  of niligiris .wow! that was amazing moment of my life. we had many clicks and selfies.after boat ride, we had snacks  near the foot of the small hill.food is really relishing .climate is so romantic and cloudy here, best suited for teens.there are small information centres near the hills to guide tourists.""baralikadu"" the best.super cool experience.",Baralikadu
"I visited kakkadampoyil in 19-2-2018. A beautiful place with lack of security system. This is place comes under kozhikode district and 24 kilo meters from the great nilambur town. This is wonderful park where the ideal of nature is seen. You can came here via kerala road ways. In cars or busses , motor vehicles etc. Lot of people came here to enjoy the climate and the atmosphere. I enjoyed here mountain ranges of western ghats! Beautiful and un explored place surrounded by forests. Misty hills and beautiful kozhipara water falls. But accomodation services is very bad. The hotels gave me a bad treatment. And here is a large number of security problems. If you wanted to visit here you must with a good guide to show you a clear ways. Security problems and bad accomodation made this place as average.  Kakkadmpoyil is good for visit! Keep calm it's a dangerous place. Thanks for reading my review. I gave 6 out of 10 marks for kakkadampoyil.",Kakkadampoyil
"Kakkadampoil is a very good tourist place which all people would love to go. The place is on a hill top, and has a beatiful waterfall and streams on rocks , what more can you expect. Accesibility - the place is on a hilly spot ( kakkadampoil) the travel is a good experience because the views are great. However after the rains , the roads are now creating a havoc. The turns with the gutters can give you a nightmare. Ambience - the place as such is very beautiful and the water is very fresh and anybody would love to take dip in. Security and safety- this a significant issue. The streams and the waters have no rails or anything around it to protect people from falling into the waters. Often the rocks are slippery and its a common sight to see people slipping and falling into water. And the first aid facilities and medical team is absent. This is a major drawback considering the fact that the local hospital is 1 hr away. Some people often come to wash their clothes and linens and that could defenitely be a con when tourism is taken into consideration. Overall - a beautiful place with good tourism potential but most of its potential is left unused. A good hotel and medical team and other amenities could really boost up the tourism",Kakkadampoyil
"Hi friends, as I have already told I am a travelling buff and have been to various places exploring the beauty and the nature at the fullest . I have been to baralikadu at once, I mean unfortunately I have to cancel my journey in the mid way due to some emergency but my friends went there, so on their behalf I would share their experience. Baralikadu is a nearby coimbatore, and it is well known tourist destination in tamil nadu, so let me start with the local sightseeing, i would say it to be just above average, nothing such special for which you will planned a specific journey to such a place, it's not that extraordinary kind of place. . yes there  can be some forest adventures but surely not on the risk of safety . yes, friends first and foremost important thing, when it comes to plan a journey is safety, and I would say baralikadu is not a place to blindly follow the safety aspect. secondly, it is a forest area so the developed area is far behind so  you will face the accomodation and food problem as it is obvious! I would say if  you are a local of tamil nadu, than you may go there for a day and enjoy and return in the evening but surely the place is not worthy to go with family or friends for some 2-3 days tour. so this was my experience, share yours and comment below, in case you feel so!",Baralikadu
"We went over the weekend. Left on a saturday night by tain to Kurudwadi and from there and hours drive by bus. Connections are good and the roads smooth. Climate was pleasant throughout our 1 day stay. We checked into the Akhil Bharatiya Bhavsar Kshatriya Dharamshala which is within two minutes distance from the temple. This place is clean and well maintained with basic amenities of hot water and clean toilets(indian and western). Charges are Rs 150/- for samaj members and Rs 250/- for non members. Accessibility to the temple is the key factor here. The main town of Pandharpur is basically around the temple. Now of course it has expanded quite a bit. Autos are available for transport. Min charges Rs 10/- The temple itself is very clean and well managed. There is no special darshan facility. The very aged and handicapped can take the short cut as we did. Normal darshan time  is about 4-5 hours but we came out in 45 mins thanks to my mothers walking problem. Besides the main shrine of Vithoba is the Rukmini temple. Apart from this a holy dip in the river Chandrabhaga and a visit to the Kaikade Maharaj museum are a must on every pilgrims itenarary, not to forget the holy feet. We skipped all that and only took the darshan of the two temples. The area around the temple is also very clean and walking barefoot is not a chore. Plenty of shopping for puja items in brass and copper. if you are interested in musical instruments there are a couple of shops for those as well. Haldi based kumkum is very popular from here as are the agarbattis which are locally made. Kandi pedas if you want to take some prasad home. We shopped at Deodhar Kakades which had reasonable rates for the local cotton saris, jamkhanas/shatranjis, solapur bedsheets. Next to him is Badthals, more variety but more expensive too. Food is generally the local preparation which is spicy and hot but tasty.

"I went to Pandaripur sometime in the month of May 2004. I went there by RTC bus from Hyderabad. It was a long journey for about (if I remember it correct) 8 hours. Though I was sitting in an ordinary bus (not super deluxe) that too near the driver’s seat, surprisingly I was not tired by the time I reached Pandaripur. All along I was simply chanting the maha mantra ’’ hare krishna hare krishna , krishna krishna hare hare, hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare ’ . May be I was doing this on experimental basis or may I have a belief. I can not say because I am an ardent Shiva devotee. I never worshipped Krishna. There is no idol of Krishna in my house. None of my family members worship Lord Krishna. But somehow I developed this interest to go to Phandaripur. My brother went there long,long back may be 10 years ago and I remembered about his description of the rude behaviour of pujaris, and that simply occupied my thoughts and it became a bit obsessive when I reached there. I do not know it is because of the ’’hare krishna’’ I was chanting , it seemed to me only one or two hours at best three hours but actually 8 hours passed and I finally reached Phandaripur when it was raining. It was a hot summer actually. It was hard for me to search for a good hotel. It was still drizzling and I was getting wet and my boots were filled with water but my search for a hotel did not end. Wherefrom I have got the strength I did not know. The only hotel which was air-conditioned and was also neat was very near to bus stand. It was something of an experience. The hotel fellow says that I must vacate the room early in the morning 7 am. I asked why I should. If it for 24 hours I must be allowed to stay until evening 9 pm. He told me that was fine , but I should vacate because the room was booked. I came telling him that I could not accept such a condition even though I would not likely to stay after 7 am next day.I entered and exited through many other hotels where even ankle deep water was logging in the courtyards. Finally to cut short the story I came back to nearest the bus stand and the first hotel you would see from the bus stand. I went in and from entrance it self a cow was coming out. The reception was on the first floor. He gave me a room , I think, Rs.200/= which was totally dirty and bed sheets totally ridden with all types of ’’marks’’ on them. Fan will not go to high speed , and light will not be brighter , all because of power shortage. I threw away those nasty bed sheets ,put my own which I bought and took a bath ( I had to flush out the toilet and cleaned bathroom throwing water). Finally I came out and hired an auto rickshaw to the temple. He said Rs.10/= and I said ok. Rain was still there but only a drizzle. It was a small town and water was logging even in a chow Rasta. Auto fellow finally took me to the temple and told me to get down. The moment I gave 10/= he disappeared. Thereafter some Brahmin boys sitting near the temple told me ( they were kind enough to tell me ) that I was actually on the back side of the temple !!. I should take a complete circle in the drizzling rain to go to the main entrance of the temple. I had no option and I got wet again.   The moment I entered one priest came and enquired with me weather I should do special worship and ablutions. I told ’’no’’. He began to chant out various rates pujas. I just went inside. The ’’murthi’’, the idol , of Lord Vittala , an incarnation Lord Krishna is to be seen to be believed. There is something in it. Lord Krishna is in standing position with his two hands on either side of his waist. I was taken in by him. Still I thought I was a bit preoccupied by the priests there. They stood there very near to the Lord himself and devotees are putting garlands and pujaris take them out ,facilitate another one to put garland on Lord Krishna. Somehow I suddenly felt that it was very quite and I was in a dream. The priests when they saw me as much as opposite the Lords’ idol they began to ask ( or pester ?) do I need to do a special worship. One priest even because he was not getting a clear view of me went over the shoulders of other priests and was asking me. You can see the greed on their faces. You need not have high IQ to understand that they do those ’’pujas’’ very mechanically. That entire priest standing inside sanctum sanctorum like those you see in volleyball ground and shouting one over the other ’’whether you need special pujas etc ’’ is an incident you may not believe even after my clear description. After coming out I felt that I did not pay attention to the Lord Krishna and I must go again. I felt bad that I paid attention to the priests. I felt that in my nervous I did not bow and touched the Lord’s feet. After coming out by the time 10 pm or 10:30 , I tried to find a nice hotel to eat. I could not. At some hotel finally when I sat down to eat it was dirty and the food ,the rice, was so cold that I could not eat. I got up to wash my hands ,the basin was so ugly that I could have vomited.  But near the lodging was a Tiffin hotel and I ate some Tiffin’s and went for a sleep in the room all the time thinking about a darshan next day. I was worried about the rush. I decided to get up early in the morning to go to the temple and I learnt that it would open 5 am in the morning.  Suddenly while it was still dark I felt that someone pinched me telling me to get up. I woke up instantly and there was no one except that slow moving noisy ceiling fan and myself. I went to bath room ,had a bath and walked straight toward temple. This time I did not take an auto.  I reached the temple , and I entered the temple. I was just walking inside the temple towards sanctum sanctorum and I could see the Lord now. His face was bright. There were hardly a group of devotees inside. And then I turned back. It was very surprising. Hundred of devotees suddenly started coming and by the time I was very near to the Lord , I looked back and found there was an extreme rush just behind me. They were pushing over each other and the whole queue was tightly packed inside the grills. This time I did not turn my attention towards the priests. Yet I had to see. A devotee , a woman bowed on the feet of the lord and the priest put his hand on her hips to tell her to move. I felt that he even rubbed his hand slightly.  I bowed before the Lord and this time touching his feet to my satisfaction. I looked at his face and suddenly I felt he understood me. As usual the priests over there ,many of them inside ,falling over each other , asked me if I want to do any special pujas. I ignored them and walked out. After coming out I realized that I did not buy a garland and did not put one to adore the Lord with my garland. So I wanted to go inside again. I went to the entrance. There near the entrance a Muslim boy was selling garlands. I bargained one and lifted it up standing in the direction of deity. I suddenly lost that burning desire to go inside and to adore the Lord with my garland. And the Muslim boy was telling if you enter the temple now you will take so and so time to come out. I put back the garland. I looked back to a building on the left side. It was multistoried building and it was queue shed. The people inside the queue in the building ( the queue is from inside the temple to inside that building and that too multi storied ) making noise just as would hear near a poultry form. I came back to bus stand and at enquiry counter he was nice gentle man. He told me that to a direct bus to Hyderabad would take long time because your state ( Andhra Pradesh) bus has left early in the morning. He advised me to take a bus to Pune and from there I could get any number of buses to Hyderabad. That was a nice advice and it worked very well.",Pandharpur
"I reached pandharpur at 9am. Asked one localite for stay.he was very kind man.he took meon his bike to mtdc. Mtdc people said they can provide room only if 3 persons are there. Then he took me to ""gajanan math"".there they have said they can give room only if 2 people are there. Some how i got into ""gajanan math"" with the help that local person. It was very clean and tidy.i was surprised with their kind of maintanance. For a day they are charging just rs.150/- Then i visited temple which is 5min. Walk from gajanan math(towarsds left side). I was not impressed with the way temple premises is maintained.there were people who were chewing and spitting On temple walls.i think adminstration should restrict all these things in temple premises and people should also have some common sense. Mobile phones are not allowed inside temple. Preists inside temple demand for money.dont pay more than rs.10/- Keep change with you in advance. After darshan i came back to gajanan math and took rest for 2hrs. Evening i went to bheema river which is 10 min walk from math. I enjoyed boat riding also.that fellow charged rs.20/-. I had spent 2hrs at the bank bheema and visited ""pundlik temple"" also. Near to bheema river there is temple constructed by gwalior maharajas(madhavrao scindia etc). That is also worth visiting. Aprt from these places one can also visit kaikadi maharaj math(before 6pm) and gopal pur temple also. Thanks and regards Sairam kulkarni",Pandharpur

I was with my Grandparents at this place which is away from City's hustle . We Enjoyed here Mountain ranges of Western ghats . Beautiful and unexplored place surrounded by forests , Misty Hills and Beautiful Kozhippara  Waterfalls .But what I dont like here was Bad accommodation services . All hotels are here not Good . they charge very high price with little services . It brings negative outlook.This is not safe place .You should be under guidance of your guide and Due to lack of Govt.'s focus on this place It is huge risky place at Nights .Overall Place is good but Accommodation and Safety makes it Average .",Kakkadampoyil
"Though pandharpur is a pilgrim place and is often called a the ""south kasi"". but have anyone ever took the time to see its natural surrounding. its environment? I think no that's why it is one of the most dirtiest place I have been too. As one reaches Pandharpur he knows that he is at the right place by an odour. ""THE ODOUR OF PANDHARPUR"". I mean where is the cleanliness..?? Cattle roaming in the main road, wastes scattered here and there and the drainage system too. People littering in the road.Its a common sighting in Pandharpur. A pilgrim place should be clean. Do you think that almighty lords home should be so filthy. No way.",Pandharpur
"We have planned for Pandharpur Vist to have a Darshan of Lord Krishna on yesterday. Considering Varkaris procession, we have choosen bangalore Highway from Hinjewadi Signal(Mumbai-Pune Express Highway leads to Kolhapur) Pune. Its an Excellen road till narayanpur and for another 15 Kms. Then the road on the left leads to Pandhapur. I don't remember the names of main villages on the way. No Traffic conjetion at all. I could reach pandharpur in 4 Hrs Flat from my residence at Pimpri.( Started @ 6.45 A.M- Reached pandhapur @ 10.45 A.M). Pandharpur is a town without any good infrastructure. We were searching for a good hotel and common toilet for Hrs. But couldn't find even a Single One. You can find a Common toilet near to Temple premise or in the S.T Stand in a Unhygenic Condition. We could park our Car in the Parking Lot near to the temple( Nearly less than half a KM from the temple Entrance). You can find chappel stand and Mobile Counter near the temple. Cameras, Mobiles, Ladies Hand Bags are not allowed to be taken inside the temple premise. Lots of Shops who sells Photos and Puja Items. We have been approached by Pujaris / Priests for a Quick Darshan(in 10 Min) for the rate Rs.2001 but I turn down their offer. All are cheats. For a Normal Darshan thro' a 6-7 Storey building ""Q"", It would have taken a Minimum of 5-6 Hrs on that day to have a Close darshan of Lord Panduranga. But We have decided to wait for the Miracle to happen. There is another facility called Mukh Darshan where you can have the darshan of Lord Krishna from 20- 25 feet distance . We could make that in 2 Minutes time as there used to be not much crowd over there. I wanted to get Rs.51/-Special Darshan / VIP Tickets for the darshan( as mentioned in the other review by one Mr.Raja Kumar) but to my disappointment there are no Special / VIP tickets are sold in the office. The Temple Officials are Corrupts here. You can't approach any Temple Officers / Staff memebers . the office premise is fully sealed with railings and locks. Securities doesn't give proper answers for your Quiry. You can see only lots of Pujaris in search of their preys. I have approaced a security guy(seems to be a Supervisor) to get the special Darshan ticket if any. Initially he has told me that the temple official would issue pouthi / Challan of denomination Rs.500 /- or Rs.1000 /- . That I would get in Half an hour time once the temple official comes to office. Then suddenly he disappeared from the scene. I have approached another guy who seemed to be a Office clerk . He has also promised me the same and disappeaerd suddenly from the scene . I met that security supervisor again to get the challans. he gave all irresponsible answers after that. We have waited for almost 1.5 hrs again for these people hoping to get challan properly from the office for the darshan. But to our disappointment no one has responded to our quiries or turned back at me. I was very much frustrated and told our familymemebers that we would go for Darma Darshan which would take nearly 5-6 Hrs for the darshan. Suddenly a Mad rush of small crowd entering in to Office gate for a Special Darshan. When Enquired I came to know that they have paid good money for the darshan and puja thro' some temple officer / Pujari. I could locate a Pujari there and requested him to alow us for a Darshan thro' the special Entrance. He requested Rs.750 saying that he needed to give Rs.500/ for the temple official to make the challan, Rs.50 for the security and Rs.200 / for him. Finally we have paid and got an entry in to special ""Q"" thro' office gate and could get the Darshan of Panduranga in 10 Minutes time. But Most of them Demand a Minimum of Rs.2100 /- We have Offered Rs.50/- to Lord Panduranga. The Pujari who was doing Puja for the lord asked for our Name, Gotra for doing archana. Then he offered us a Silk duppatta and Coconut and Garlands and demanded Rs.500 for that. He tried to tie the Garland on my wifes neck but my wife refused that. When we refused to pay Rs.500 /, the pujari / priest got so much angry and took back the dupatta, Coconut, garland and Banana and he was cursing also. The same thing happened with Radha Shrine also. Here he has done the same with Sari and demanded Rs.500. That also I refused to give. He has taken the saree back Then we went to Gopal Pur(I don't remember Exactly). There also same thing happened. Since the temple is small, the priest demanded Rs.100/. When we have refused, he has taken all the prasad back. Really all Money Minded People. Cheats. Finally We had our Darshan of Lord Panduranga. Anyhow, These Priests never llowed us in pray in peace. Here the Darshan is not like Tirupathi or Shirdi where the Security people push the devotees and don't allow you to stand in front of the ""Moorthy"" for long time. Here the priests allow the people to stand in front of the Idol for 2 to 3 Minutes if you offer them Money. Each and every devotee is given chance to toch the feet of Lord Panduranga. So, It takes very long time for the Q"" to move. In Shirdi and Tirupati, Its a Mass Darshan and Noone is allowed to touch the idol. So, the Q"" Move very fast. Some times you can have the Darshan in Half an Hour also. But Here it is different due to the said reason and you need to stand for very long time in Dharma Darshan. Finally we left the place at 1.45 P.M, went to Gopal Pur. had the same kind of Bad Experience. If you don't give the demanded money, your prasadam would be taken back. If you r menatlly week, you will feel psychologically bad. I have missed the original way on the way to Pune. 3-4 different routes to Pune. Finally I got the Phalton route. Came to Shirwal, took the route to Pune(Successfully avoided Vakaris again). On the way we have visited Narayanpur Balaji Temple also. It took us some time for the darshan. Finaaly We reached home @ 9.45 P.M in the Night. Be prepared in Pandhapur. Pujaris / Temple Officials / Brokers are the real Thieves.",Pandharpur

Almost all good hotels are around 15-20 min away from station.it is better  to book for accommodation beforehand than to go there and start hunting, then they will charge heavily.many tour operators claim to be good but we did from mtdc.

"We went to Aurangabad for couple of days during the Diwali weekend & I found the city to be execellent.So, thought of writing my first review here, as I have got lot of help from other's reviews while planning my trip:-). And I will be more focussing on conveyance/accommodation/food and less description on the historical values of the places, because I feel the historic importance of places can be easily found on the net/any good books, but it is more difficult to find information about accomodation/food etc. I am staying in Pune, it takes around 5-6 hrs on an average from Pune to Aurangabad via VOLVO.There are also state buses available running in frequent interval, these buses start from Shivaji Nagar bus stand.Suitable VOLVO bus timings are 6am(reaches A'bad around 12pm), midnight(reaches A'bad next morning 6am) and 2-3pm which reaches A'bad  around 9pm. I was preferring to catch the early morning bus, so that I reach A'bad in the afternoon & I have sufficient time to find hotels etc.But because of the diwali rush, I had difficulty in getting bus tickets, otherwise in normal time, I think if you book your tickets in advance around 3-4 days, it would be sufficient. But in long weekends, it is better to plan as early as possible. Anyway, so I took the 3pm bus & reach A'bad arond 10pm, the reason being heavy traffic & the roads from Ahmednagar to Aurangabad very bad, The road from Pune to Ahmednagar is quite good, but gets worse after Ahmednagar, so people should think before going there on their personal cars, but taking your personal car has its own advantage, which I will be describing below. I had made early reservation in MTDC resort(standard double bed room 900/=. family room with 3bed 1000/= etc both Non-AC, did not check for the AC tariff).I booked over phone and it did not require me to pay anything in advance.There is also provision to book over net through MTDEC website, but I am not sure whether it requires any advance payment.One note for people booking over phone, please call them 2-3 days before your journey and also on the journey day/the day before to confirm your booking, because for telephone booking, there is no such booking confirmation document. After reaching A'bad, I thought of looking for some other hotels, whether I get anything better in cheaper prices.But keeping the constraint in mind, that we reached there around 10pm & I went there with my wife, i preferred to stay at the MTDC hotel only, after visiting 1-2 hotels in stn road, which I did not like.But my suggestion would be, if you are in a group or reach there not as late as I reached, try to look for some more hotels, you might get better deal. We reached there on Sat night.Sunday, we headed for Monday we headed for There is also a place called Paithan, which I heard very good, but I did not go there, rather did not have time. Feedback about the MTDC resort is that it is ok kind of, but I feel one should get better deal.In our room, there was no intercomm working, no geaser working etc.And there was 2 more family, who had AC room & they even did not have proper water supply in their room.I had my return bus on 6am, so requested for a wakeup call, did not get that even:-(So, my suggestion would be to look for better hotel, but the positive about the resort is it is very quiet, no concern of security etc. Overall, I found the place to be quite good.A very good option for a weekend trip.If you have school/college going children/you are kind of peple fond of history/art/culture, you will find the place very good.Otherwise, you may find the place to be boring",Aurangabad
As iam citizen of India guys I dont want to put any place of a country down as iam. But last year I had been for a trip to Tamil nadu with my family. I had visited to Sri Ranga temple. The sculptures in the temple was beautiful designed I appreciate them for stilm saving the olden days sculptures n carvings of gods. There is no proper queue system for gods darshanam.And people there are very rough.They dont even mind that they are in temple and start fighting with each other n abuse people with bad words.And there is also discrimination between people who pay more are sent in a special darshnam queue.And they are many robbery activities also inside the temple.,Srirangam
"My hometown is Aurangabad and ofcourse Aurangabad is a good city in every aspects.Here you will find many industries in field of electrical, mechanical, chemical, automobile etc.Aurangabad was in news of Asias fastest growing city, and really the city have right to persue that credit. There is no great political hand behind the progress of this city, This city is developing on its own heritage and knoweldge of people and there hard work. City is well known as city of history and its culture.I will say that if Aurangabad having good IT MNC then it will be competition to Pune and ya really Pune is well developed due IT industries.",Aurangabad

"We stayed in Aurangabad - VITS. The place is very good. The hotel stay was excellent. The ambience, rooms and staff was very good. I had heard about this lonar crater which is in Aurangabad - buldhana district. To my surprise this is the 3rd largest crater in the World. I went to this place as there was no other availability in nearby Mumbai being a weekend on 24- 26 jan. We went in winters. However it seems the place is very beautifull in Rains with peacock. This crater was formed 52000 years ago. Its around 150 km from Aurangabad. The roads are good. the path down is adventurous and recommend a guide. There are 14 temples build on this crater which 1000 ft in diameter. The water formed in the lake is said to have a high ph value and is salty. The locals beleive that the water is very medicinal. There is a stream which connects to the lake and the water is clean and sweet of the stream. This place is extremely offbeat location and not at all commercialised. However Indian tourism should develop such places. Enjoy",Aurangabad

The God Srimannarayana Swamy is Sri Narasimha's avatara.

She said with a smile, I got you as husband, that is outstanding for my life, but now there are fewerDivya Kshetras on earth so the devotees can not go there because of expenses. The Devotees are facing problems without God’s Darshan, so please make one Divya Kshetra for our devotees.The God accepted the Mahalakshmi request. The God said to Vanamala to make a wonderful Parvata  on earth, so that hill Vanamala has changed into Malyadri .

"This was my second visit to Maharashtra after 43 long years and the first pilgrimage to Shirdi. A quintessential experience, insofar as it warranted disengagement from the daily chores and cares for existence and the virtues of procrastination as an empowering means to repose and reflect. I took the Jet Konnect flight, and even the aeriel view of the city showed Aurungabad as a progressive, as well as a heritage and culturally rich city, with major automobile, pharmaceutical and other service sector multinationals setting base here. The Chikkalthana Airport of Aurungabad, where our flight landed, is state-of-the-art, yet compact airport with modern passenger handling amenities. The city is dotted with numerous hotels that are very clean, hospitable and offering sumptuous meals at very reasonable rates. In fact far more reasonable than what we are used to in north India. The dark soil of the state of Maharashtra that we criss-crossed for over 800 kms, is very fertile and besides the highways one can buy clean refreshing and very reasonably priced sugarcane juice, onions and observe the traditional farming practices that have preserved the nutrition of the soil. The trucks on the highways drove in a far more civilised manner than what one is accustomed to seeing in north India. The people are far more docile and down to earth in this state. In the 4 days of whirlwind tours, I came across multitudes of Indians and fellow Hindus. This was a tour where unquestioning faith was supreme. Every day lakhs of devotees would ungrudging subject themselves to hours of waiting in serpentine queues, following methods that were not changed or reinvented for decades. The caves at Ajant and Ellora needed to be better preserved. This was all the more tragic because as a civilisation that had built monolithic structures, carved out in the metamorphic rocks with only muscle power and the ascetic will of a scientifically working mind, long before the Western world was civilized with the sciences and arts of construction and building. However, the month of April being too hot, but for the well air-conditioned and hospitable accommodation, and the reasonably priced taxi service, this trip would have only been half as joyous as it was for us.",Aurangabad

I can travel to Dalhousie in 2011 in my school tour to chamba.We firstly tour the Banikhet which is 6km below from the Dalhousie. @.Firstly we are going in Volvo bus we reach at Dalhousie at 11am and stop our bus near a petrol pump Dalhousie. @.Its also be an army cantt area below bus stand .The bus stand is very small .We can travel in the month of January in snowfall time and its be famous place to see snowfall around hill. The everything covered with snow but the road or bus stand cleared by the snow cutter machines.There are few shops around bus stand and of high standard shops all thing are worthy then the below area market.Its be an hill station many of houses are only of wood. We can also travel to Dalhousie puRobotouchc school.And then we are going to Gandhi chowk which is most famous in Dalhousie where you can see snow all around.Its also the tip mist place of the hill. The road from bus stand to Gandhi chowk covered with snow till now that and road all around covered by big tress .Its looks like that we are in the forest natural beauty and only a road between there. So at the last we reach at Gandhi chowk where a statue of Mahatama Gandhi placed between the connecting roads . The Dalhousie named also on the name of A British officer Lord Dalhousie  which he can get that place through his cleverness from king of Chamba. A@.So we get lunch their at Gandhi chowk and done some what shopping and then proceed to Chamba at 4pm almost. Dalhousi is looks like a picture in my mind the natural area with which trees and snow increases his beauty but only the thing and eating things are little worthy due to tourist attraction area . Its clear hill station and I can like it so much . We can also taking number of pics there and temperature of Dalhousie is very low sometime.so always takes woollen cloths with you. @.

"As the very name suggests, It was built under King Narasimhadeva in the 13th century. The entire temple was designed in the shape of a colossal chariot, carrying the sun god, Surya, across the heavens The massive structure, now in ruins, sits in solitary splendour surrounded by drifting sand. Today it is located two kilometers from the sea, but originally the ocean came almost up to its base. Each and every portion of the temple is covered with sculptures of deities, celestial and human musicians, dancers mythoogical creatures interspersed with scultures of birds and animals. Famous for erotic sculptures it goes at par with sculptures found in Ajanta and Ellora. Close by is one of the most attractive beaches of the world - the Chandrabhaga beach.",Konark

"Kasauli is one the mostly visited tourist place and the majority of people are from nearby states like punjab, haryana and Delhi .the main attractions of kasauli are the market, its sunset point and most beautiful is the mann ki point.which is located at the height of approx 6400ft. I will share with you my experience there.I visited kasauli at my aunt's home in the month of feb with couple of friends.her home was like on the top of valley surrounded by dense devdar trees.her home is like 15-20min.walking distance from the main road so its like amazingly silence.no traffic .nothing , and you could actally hear the wind going through your ears.so the next day my cousion ( aunt's son) took us for a jungle safari.and I was fascinated by the sceneries and the patterns of cloud formation in the sky were majestic.i mean at the sunset I saw all the colours in the sky.i felt like gazing that sky forever and capturing that moment.we build little houses with stones for little insects.and much more.So we returned back, had dinner at night and we again went for a lil adventure in the woods.we gathered some woodsticks .lit the bonfire and then began the fearfiles.i mean we had variety of conversation ranging from our childhood memories to our future goals.becoming entreperneurs , our lovelife , college crush and all sort of boyish talks.that night it was all clear dark black sky with millions of bright twinkling stars.with drinks and best buddies.what would have anyone asked for more than this at that moment.we sat and drank under the open sky and our sholuders felt like a free mens.such experience can't be narrated and can only be lived.and guys we also visited mann ki point.its just.over whelming.the view from top its just like vision of infinity .but the sad part is that you are not allowed to take any mobile, camera or any other electronic equipment inside as inside the hill at top of which the temple is located, is a hidden base camp of IAF( indian air force) .the IAF stire its varoius technlogy and weapons there.and no one can figure out the entrance gates except the air force officials.so this thing's kinda intresting.so all the people planning to visit kasalui should definately visit these places and explore the nature.! .",Kasauli

"Amritsar is a border city in the northern state of Punjab in India. Amritsar is easily accessibly by road, rail and by air. If you stay in Mumbai and are willing to visit Amritsar by train then Paschim express is the best train . It take 36 hrs to reach Amritsar  which is much less than other train going to Amritsar from Mumbai. There are very less direct flights to Amritsar from Mumbai. Normally there is a halt in Delhi then there is next flight till Amritsar. Once you reach Amritsar there are many hotels available to stay of all price range. You can also stay in the guest house  in the Golden Temple. The main attractions of Amritsar are the Golden Temple, Jallianwala Bagh and Beating the retreat ceremony that is held every evening at Attari border. Golden Temple is one of the spiritual places of India, it is of great importance for Sikhs. The Golden Temple is completely made of gold and is surrounded by sarovar. Once you enter inside Golden Temple you can feel the peace that you are surrounded with. You must try the langar in the golden temple once and should also help in serving it. The Golden Temple is  very beautiful. Then next to Golden temple is Jallianwala Bagh where the massacer took place. You must also visit there. And last but not the least beating the retreat ceremony at the Attari-Wagha border which takes place every evening where lowering of the national flags of both the nations take place. So atleast one in your life you must visit Amritsar.",Amritsar

"Amritsar(Punjab) is a must visit city in North India. It is a beautiful urban city with lot of places that are big tourist attractions where thousands of visitors come everyday. I traveled to Amritsar during my trip to North India(Himachal Pradesh). Dalhousie, my destination spot was accessible by road from Amritsar. I spent a whole day and night in Amritsar and was mesmerised by seeing the beauty of the city. It is sad to say that I had only one day there and So, here I am telling about the places I visited there and from me, they are huge recommendation for every traveler. Wagha Border - It is the India Pakistan border and the gate is opened once a day. At around 4 PM, a military program is organised and it is great patriotism to watch that event. Best thing in Amritsar. Oswal Wholesale and Retail - Large winter wear maufacturers outlet for shopping. The Golden Temple - Abode on Earth. The best temple I have ever visited in my whole life. Over three lakh people are served free meals there. Fully golden architecture. Extremely beautiful scene. Just loved the experience there. Jallianwala Bagh - The historical place where hundreds of Indians were killed by British Governor General's order. Now converted into a museum and amusement mark. Must visit place in Amritsar. These were the tourist places we visited in Amritsar. Acommodation - We had booked the Hotel La-Cascade which was an extremely good hotel. Had a great experience there as well!",Amritsar
"Amritsar is one of the best place I have ever been too. This is the best city for foodies, devotes. artists and everybody who wants to enjoy life and to come close to Nature and God. It is so easy to go there. There are various trains from different parts of India. You can check IRCTC site for different Trains Schedule. Apart from that there is a beautiful and magnificent Airport, Raja Sansi Airport and has regular flights from Delhi.  There are various tourist spots. Some of them are Golden Temple, JallianWala Bagh, Akal Takht, Shaheedan Sahib, Durgiana Temple, Wagah Border, Ranjit Singh Museum and may other. I will prefer you to go there for min 3 three days and I would be best If you go on Sunday included as there is a  special parade on that day from Indian Side. For foodies, It is the best place. Dal makhani, Chicken, Kulchas(Stuffed aloo Paranthas), Mathi chane,  Kulcha(This one is special type only available in Amritsar) are some of the best items for foodies. Of course, who can forget'LASSI'. Hotels are well and Safety if totally ensured. You can always find some deals on some online booking website. Police and people are very Corporative. A prepaid cab is preferred and negotiating should be done as they charge too much for Wagah Border. I will advice you should visit there once in lifetime.",Amritsar

The accessibility was very nice there. People were very friendly and we faced no problem while reaching there. The roads and climate was very cool and pleasent. The local sightseeing was also nice. The mountains, rivers, local food and pleasent climate made it a perfect place for us. The hotels were very costly there. We didn't expect the rates to be that much high. It is one of the most safest and secured place for us. I really loved spending time there. I will give it 4/5 stars.",Kasauli

We easily find a hotel, Which is clean and very quit in between the mountain. We all go in various places in Kasauli and enjoy there. We feel safe, because the local peoples are very honest.

It is not very far from Chandigarh. It is under controlled by both Indian Army and Airforce.And this made the place to calm an beairiful. No Nature lover will never deny to come to this place. I have visited 2 times to Kasauli , Once with friends and another once with my family and relatives. Hotel accommodation are bit costly when visited. Its sunrise and sunset is just fantabulous and breathtaking and when the cloud comes you will feel like you're in the cloud. There was a famous saint in a temple. Peoples which have not child are  often visit to the saint to get blessed for child.There are many good places to visit such as Manki Point, Gilbert trails, Christ Church etc. It is one of cleanest place in India. In India everybody should learn to be clean like this place. Thank you.",Kasauli
Its a Awesome Place To spend Their Vacation And Spend their Leisure Time. Its not good as compared to shimla.nanital or ather hill station But its not mean it is not for the tourist. Last week I went to kasauli. There is one church that is very famouse church. People think its not a good place as like shimla but belive me its beter than those place. some benifit to go to kasauli No extra crowd here as compared to other hill station. Rooms Rent is cheap. One sun set point here monkey point Things are chaep I felt really happy when I was go there.,Kasauli

It is 65 Km from Chandigarh, It is a beautiful hill station surrounded by the Aravallis range of mountains. It has the popular Hanuman temple situated at the top. Small waterfalls add to its beauty. Calm place. Local sightseeing not so much except for the Monkey point. Local market is there. One can easily avail good accomodation in Kasauli. Good hotels and restaurants are there. It is quite peaceful and calm place to visit. Safe for the visitors.",Kasauli
"I enjoyed with my family in Kasauli during summer which is a small and silent hill station in Himachal Pradesh.I enjoyed the pleasant climate of Kasauli and observed that it is enclosed by dense forests.Some of its destinations which I really liked are as under. 1.Kasauli Club:I came to know that its establishment resulted as the Kasauli Reading and Assembly Room with the help of local population and the service personals stationed in the town. 2.Manki Point:Its location is in the Air Force Station near the Local Mall Region and at a distance of nearly 4km from the centre of the town 3.Christ Church:It has imported stained glass windows which depicts Saint Francis, Jesus Christ and a few others. 4.Krishna Bhawan Mandir:It is a Hindu temple which is devoted to Lord Krishna.The temple has been constructed keeping in mind the principles of Vastu Shastra. 5.Nahri Temple:It is devoted to Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga. I purchased few Handicrafts, Jams and Woolen Clothes for my family which were available at very affordable rates.While walking, we enjoyed sweet and soothing sounds of birds and gentle rustling of leaves.At no point of time, we found to be unsafe which is vice-versa in few of the tourist places.",Kasauli
One of the reasons I like it is safeness. I visited Dalhousie in summer because I believe it is the best time to do it(April-June). Rock garden is one of the best places to visit in Dalhousie Himachal Pradesh. This place is worth visiting to spend some peaceful time. I recommend it.,Dalhousie
"Kasauli is a beautiful hill station before Shimla. It takes around 2-3 hours to reach Kasauli from Chandigarh depending upon the rush and days you are planning to visit. If you are planning for the weekend, be ready to face jam and rush. But it’s all worth it at the end. Kasauli is a very beautiful place and not as crowded as Shimla. If you want to relax , chill , enjoy the nature and hills this the right place for you. It has a variety of places to visit, my favourite turns out to be the mall road and the church. The church is located at a beautiful location with an awesome view, Totally worth it! It is always a good time to visit there and spend some time enjoying the nature. You can enjoy being there in any weather. Overall it’s a beautiful place to relax and enjoy mother nature. I totally love this place!",Kasauli
My trip to kasauli has been amazing.The way to kasauli is very narrow as only one car can pass at a time which makes it much more exciting.There are several places to visit like Suicide point and Manki point.Manki point is at the top of a mountain inside an army base where you have to climb around a 1000 stairs.Cell phones are not allowed inside the base.The mall road is amazing.You can get clothes and several other decoration stuffs at a very cheap price.The view in kasauli is very beautiful.,Kasauli
"I want to share my personal experience about Kasauli tourist place. This place is very popular and many tourists are coming for entertainment. This place accessibility is not bad, but I do not like this inside structures. This place location is good because many local sightseeing of this place. This place is made in a very developed area so many hotel near of this place and good transport links with other places. This place safety is very good.",Kasauli
"Kasauli is quite hill station with full of nature. Its situated 60 KM from Chandigarh. Being a cantonment board, Its  50% area is controlled by Indian Army and rest by Indian Airfore.  This has become a blessing in disguise for it. If you are a nature lover Kasauli invites you with wide open arms. You can enjoy Sunset, Sunrise, Clouds, Trees, Wildflowers, in its purest form.  You can spend a day or two in the laps of nature.  It's a favourite weekend destination for the people of Chandigarh and Punjab.Accommodation is reasonable and you will find good stays ranging from INR 1200 to INR 15000. Be aware that on long weekends there is great rush and hotels are pre-booked. So make your arrangements in advance.But if you are looking for a crowdy place with lots of hustle and bustle then it's not your kind of destination. Kasauli is away from the concrete development which is taking place in most of the hill stations. Its one of the cleanest places in India.  Although you can enjoy nature anywhere in Kasauli, there are some places where you can feel the beauty and silence. Some of them are listed below. 1) Manki Point: It is believed that Lord Humana while carrying Sanjivini placed his foot over this hill. This whole hilltop is situated at an altitude of Approx 6000 Ft and is in the shape of big foot. Also, you can have a clear view of Chandigarh from here. Its beautiful and you can enjoy the freshness of the air. You have to climb a steep mountain for 500 M before reaching this place. But its worth and you will enjoy the serenity of this place. Beware of Monkeys. They are in abundance do not carry eatables with you.Note: This place is maintained by Airforce and there is very high security. So you will not be allowed to carry your cellphones and cameras. So please be aware of this. They will not even provide you lockers. You have keep in your car itself. 2) Gilbert Trail: Its 300 M nature walk between pine trees and Flowers. Flowers are in rainy season. 3) Christ Church, Lower and upper mall. CRI( Central Research Institute), Kasauli Club are some other attractions. 4) You can also enjoy sunrise and sunset points. 5) In Rainy season you can feel between the clouds. 6) You can also visit the Institution Lawrance school Sanawar. Which is one of the best schools in India.",Kasauli

But after all it is the best place for enjoying with and without family.",Kasauli

Features Cold atmosphere. Natural beauty. Good travel facility. Simple food and accommodation. Less expensive.",Ooty
"I am sharing my experience of my trip to ooty. The place is really beautiful and mesmerizing. The tourist sites are really beautiful especially the peaks. The dodabetta peak was one of my favourite place in ooty to visit. The chilly air, mountain peak and awesome view. The dolphin peak is also really beautiful. And the hotels there are also really good. I stayed in a hotel called the lotus and the rooms were beautiful and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were clean and with a bathtub. The food in the hotel was very good especially the north indian food. Also  the markets are really good and the south indian food was awesome in the restaurants there.",Ooty
"I had been there 35 years before and wondered the beauty. Now I visited recently on 07.10.2019 and found the beauty gone, we found only buildings rather than hills, Dodda betta view point gives very flat plain view, lake water colour turned dark brown, whole place is ugly with garbage, still advertisement showing plastic free Nilgiri, may be only plastic is missing all the rest you could find. pedestrian walk way to Botanical garden has scattered horse dung all the way, so we could not able to walk and opt for the walk way on the other side and that was occupied by toilet cubicles. Everywhere people milking money from tourists. I have checked with other family members and friends family whether they like it?  everyone replied that we could have gone to some other place.  So, we have taken an Oath not to visit Ooty again and warn other who by mistake making plan to trip. Accordingly I request the tourists to boycott Ooty as it is just a concrete jungle not a hill station.",Ooty
"So, I went to Ooty in 2017 in July. According to me it is a one time visit place, although it does not have that uch monuments but it does have very beautiful views, according to me among all the hill stations it has the best views, and different gardens just as rose garden and other gardens, and also one should definitely take a ride im the Toy Train of Ooty, it takes to a good amount of time at leaset an hour and gives us the ride of the whole city, wonderful viewing is possible from the Toy Train. Concluding ny review I would suggest everyone to visit Ooty at least once in there lifetime. I hope to this helps everyone of you. Thankyou.",Ooty
"Ooty, the queen of the Nilgiris, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South India.  Ooty is one of the largest and most enjoyable tourist destinations in South India.This place is full of beautiful hills and vegetation.  .  What makes Ooty so beautiful is the backdrop of the snow-covered sapphires.  Ooty is also referred to as the 'Queen of Hills'due to its beautiful climate, mountain range and scenic beauty.  Agriculture is the main source of income for the town.  Visitors can enjoy tasty foods with medicinal herbs and Indian spices.  Tea plantations and coffee plantations spread across the greenery make this place a tourist attraction.  There are many famous estates as well. Horticulture is the main source of income for the locals.  There are many tourist places in and around Ooty . Ooty is also celebrated with flowers and spices.  The Botanical Garden, Doddabetta Peak, Ooty Lake, Kal Hathi Falls and Flower Show are just a few of the many sights to behold in Ooty.  In April, there is a long flow of travelers to Ooty.  Flowershow is a popular tourist attraction in Ooty. The Botanical Garden is a 22-hectare meadow and awaits travelers.

"In today's time, I will tell you some special stories about harmindar sahab gurudwara amritsar, to all the people, and especially to our punjabi brothers and sisters.

"This Christmas, we decided to take a holiday to Masingudi and Ooty. We had planned to spend more time at a jungle resort in Masinagudi. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience at the resort and decided to check out early next day and proceed to Ooty, which turned out to be a wise decision. To reach Ooty from Bangalore, one has to travel via Mysore-Nanjangud-Gundlupet-Bandipur and Mudumulai till we reach Theppekadu. At this point, there are two routes to Ooty, the longer one is via Gudalur and takes 1 1/2-2 hours, the route travels through mountainous zig zag roads and on of the way you come across attractions like Pykara falls and boat house, Shooting point, etc. The other route is through Kalhatty ghats. You can reach Ooty within 45mins-1 hour in this route. But the ghat roads are extremely steep with 36 hair pin bends, all of which are very steep. Take this route, only if you are an experienced driver. It was a misty day when we took this road and visibility was very poor. Fortunately, our driver was experienced and we encountered no problems. By the time we covered half the distance, the Sun God decided to smile on us and dissolved the mist opening up an amazing panorama of views. You can see all around the Nilgiris covered by mist and it seems to be above the clouds. Ooty is known as the Queen of Hill Stations and is a very popular destination for honeymooners. No wonder thanks to the beautiful and scenic views one can encounter all around Ooty. The only sad thing was that we could spend just half a day here. This is a place where you must spend minimum two days - in fact three days would be ideal to completely enjoy this paradise on Earth. Some of the wonderful places in Ooty: 1) Lake : This is the heart of Ooty located nearthe bus stand. Just like every other hill station, this lake too has boating facilities, a park where people can spend a relaxing 1-2 hours. Apart from the boating, other attractions at the Lake include a mini-train, thread garden and deer park. Horse riding is a mandatory thing to do at Ooty. Be prepared to shell out 100-150 for a trot. 2) Botanical Gardens : is a visual treat for nature lovers. A variety of flora is on display here. This is another place where you can easily spend many hours enjoying the beauty of nature. 3) Doddabetta : is a mountain nearby Ooty which is the highest view point. There are telescopes from where you can see the whole of Ooty. Since we went on a misty day, we skipped this place as the view would be blocked by mist. 4) Pykara : is a place just a little after Ooty on the Gudalur Road. The place boasts of a waterfall (be prepared for a 1KM trek), a lake and a dam. The Pykara lake is bigger than the Ooty lake and is relatively less crowded. This is a place you can cover on your return journey. 5) Shooting point : is a hillock just outside Ooty, which has been the location for many a film shoot. You need to climb a steep hill from where you can get a bird's eye view of Ooty. Nice place to click photos, do some hill climbing or even some horse riding. A visit to Ooty must include a visit to nearby Coonor, where you there are many places worth seeing like Sims Parks, Dolphins Nose and other attractions. Unfortunately, due to paucity of time we had to skip this place. Shopping  : Ooty is famous for tea and coffee. As you travel through Ooty, you can see the various tea plantations. The Ooty coffee is not for 'Bru' lovers, it is very rich and strong. And of course, the Nilgiri hills is famous for the Eucalyptus tree and Nilgiri oil. Home made chocolates are another attraction here. And like any other hill station, a variety of spices like cinnamon, clove, etc can be bought here. Make sure you go to the market area, where you can get a good price. Avoid the department stores and main areas for shopping. Food : Ooty being in Tamil Nadu has a variety of South Indian special food items. But we could see lots of Punjabi Dhaba and other 'multi-cuisine restaurants'. We had lunch at the Saravanas Ooty restaurant, where you get authentic South Indian thali meals. Accomodation : Since we went on a day visit, we didn't stay in Ooty. But, accomodation in plenty is available all over Ooty and in Coonor. But make sure you book in advance. We made a wise decision to visit Ooty in the winter, which is off-season. Even though the weather was very cold, it was manageable. If you visit Ooty in the season (summer), it would resemble a circus with multitude of people thronging all the places. You can definitely NOT have a relaxing time in summer, because of the rush.  Also, avoid Ooty during the monsoons as the rain is terrible in these parts. In fact, this years rain rained havoc in the area, washing off many roads. In fact the famous Ooty toy train has been cancelled due to the heavy damage to the tracks. Recommendation : If you like nature and hills, if you want to enjoy your holidays in a pleasant climate, then Ooty is the place to go. Everyone should visit the Queen of hill stations once in their life.",Ooty

Same thing observed while walking through many streets, street near Tamilnadu hotel, yuck, this needs correction, sorry ooty is beautiful but this is a huge put off for tourists.",Ooty

"Nestled in Himachal Pradesh, this beautiful picturesque place lies directly in the lap of the mountains. This beauty can be enjoyed at all times of the year. It has a different kind of beauty in Summer or in Winter. Nearby visiting places are Chamba, Khajjiar, Dharamshala, etc. We had stayed at hotel Grand View during December and though it was a bit expensive but the view from our rooms were worth each penny spent. There are a large number of hotels available and at variable rates. Best time to visit though is from May till September. Tourist cars are also available at very cheap rates. But definitely do some research before visiting the place as that will help you in taking in the beauty of the place.",Dalhousie

"During last Christmas holidays, I decided to drive down to Ooty, Mysore and Bangalore. I had been to Ooty about a decade back and read that it had kind of lost its charm now, however my wife wanted to visit this hill-station and I wanted to enjoy the drive - hence the trip! From Goa, I headed via Hubli to NH-4 This is a pleasure drive! From Mysore to Nanjangudu - Gudlupete, its normal state-highway road with some traffic. Then you pass through Bandipur National Sanctuary. The road is full of greenery, however a small single lane road, mostly broken at places, with lot of speed-breakers hence you have to always negotiate while giving sides to other vehicles etc. Here you will cross the Karnataka/TN state border and enter TN state. After that there are two routes one can take, one which is via Masinagudi which is shorter, however with 36 hair-pin bends and which is the most interesting part of driving I did the first one! During my childhood trip to Ooty I had been a passenger in the car and this time I was on the wheels. I read few reviews about this route, some were scary while some gave proper instructions on how to drive, what precautions to take etc. Basically, this about 12-13 kms stretch of steep road, with 36 hair-pin bends, some scary & challenging, some simple. As the road cuts through the mountains, the temperature keeps falling and one starts becomes somewhat breathless even with some walking. I stopped on the way once, just to give some rest to the car engine and to let the tires cool down All the bends are done some 15-20 mins and you feel nice once you are done with all of them. A few kms from there you reach the main town. Yes, the place is nice and yes its a lot commercialized. You would see, ads saying welcome to Nilgiris, keep it clean etc. The first thing you notice are the crowded concrete buidings - restaurants, guest houses, shops - it clearly shows that all people want here is to make money from the tourism industry. Weather is a huge plus. The day temprature was pretty soothing and pleasant with plenty of sunlight, however the same started falling down as the sun set and reached below 10 degrees in the night. The town starts shutting down by 7-8 pm, make sure you have your dinner done by then. Yes, Eucalyptus oil, local home-made chocolates, woolen wear, Tea powder, soaps, spices etc. Try eating raw reddish carrots sold at the road-side. Chocolates were a disappointment as they tasted the likes of normal dairy milk/milky-bar. Tea powder also same story - Like all tourists do, I had listed few places to visit while in Ooty Hopeless, there is nothing to see or do here, except lying around and taking walks. Nice for boating and has variety of other games/events to do like Bumping cars. for spectacular view of valley. Take Ooty-Coonor Again, nothing much, heard its best during April when the roses bloom. - Beautiful scenery all around the lake. Plenty of options and I don't think one needs a reservation(Dec is kind of off season, though we saw a lot of tourists around). We went without any prior reservation and on a friend's suggestion, stayed at a placed called Manthada, 4 kms from away from the main town - which was an excellent places to stay All in all, agreed Ooty is kind of losing its sheen but one can surely enjoy the weather",Ooty

Dalhousie is a very small but beautiful place although for people of other Hill stations won't find anything interesting there except khajjiyar but If you are planning to visit Dalhousie from a place which has hot climate conditions and very busy life. Then you are planning to visit a right place to go because its climatic conditions are very pleasant In summers and cold in winters if you want to see snow. But at the same time I want to tell you if you are also from some hilly area and there is nothing to see in Dalhousie just go there see khajjiyar and come back then don't waste time there and plan to go some where else.,Dalhousie
"Dalhousie is the one of the best place to visit in Himachal Pradesh .  It is  very peaceful city  with natural beauty, there are only few places to visit there but when u will visit those places u fill forgett every thing and will enjoy that moment.The Places to visit in dalhousie  are khajjiar, Kalatop, Dainkund valley, Panjpulla . Amongest these people usually went to khajjiar because it is more popular than the other places . They dont visit other places and say that there is not much to see in dalhousie .Kalatop is a place same as wildlife sanctuary  u will listens the sounds of insects there and it seems like they are singing, it will really  good and changes are mod drastically  from good to awesome. Dainkund valley is  very above the sea level  and when u will go there  u wil see flower everywhere it looks loke snow is on the ground but they are flowers .There is a tempel located at dainkund valley and many people go there to take the blessings .The best time to visit dalhousie is during winters i.e from decemeber to jan . Because at that time lot of snowfall happens .Usually there is very less traffic in dalhousie but as soon as winter starts the traffic increases and the rooms of the hotel also start getting booked. People should not worry about where they will stay . There are more than enough Hotels there after every one and half km u can see a hotel .The services of the hotel is also very good there so u can go there and enjoy the beauty. During summer  also u can visit dalhousie because the temperature is very less according to the other places so will feel relax and will be able to enjoy every singel moment.And now I will talk about the safety of dalhousie there is air force and armed forces there so u can everywhere without any fear . The roads are also very good as it has improved in last 5 years a lot . It was in a very poor condition because of heavy rainfalls and landslides . But know all the roads are almost safe with no cracks on the road .I know all of this because I live in dalhousie and with my own experience im telling u this,  please visit dalhousie im damn sure u will take al lot of unforgetful memories with u.",Dalhousie
Hello all today I want to discuss with my one of best tourist place I ever visited .First I tell you DALHOUSIE is situated in the Chamba district in HP. As u know HP is coolest place in India so dalhousie as well. This is very wonderful palace to spent our holidays there. I was going for the survey camp there. we stayed 10 days in the dalhousie . It is very easy to reach there because there is also bus availability to reach the final destination. From Pathankot the distance of dalhousie is only 85 km but it is steep height from there. Famous about dalhousie is its climate as I go in the summer there was ultimate climate there. as in the june we take blankets .you can idea how its cool there. For staying the best and or I can say cheapest place is YOUTH HOSTEL their accommodation facility are very good as well as food quality. for local sightseeing there is a market for wood items . There is also a palace named' KHAJJIAR' which is few miles from there. it is also a hill station which have a very beautiful scenery .A large ground cover with the grass all around and lot of long trees around it make it very charming and rest the climate do. I also attach some of the pics.So in last I can say we should must watch this beautiful palace prefer in summer. THANKU,Dalhousie
"I visited dalhousie in oct, 2015 and  july, 2017. The place to spend your perfect holiday with family, very beautiful. No rush at all and local people are nice ober there though be aware of your belonging. In my experience the hotel people are disgracing the honesty of local people. Incidence: I foegot my phone in my hotel room but before leaving I realizing it must be in hotel then I run to my hotel room and found it locked ( note: I left the hotel room just 10 mins before) . Then I get into the kitchen and cum sleeping area of cleaners and the one who manage's hotel. When I asked him abt the phone he said bhaisahab room saaf ho chuka h or koi phone ni mila. At the same time I called on my no. And it rang in front of me under writing pad which was placed to hide it. Even though he said you cant take this phone without giving bakshish to the person who found it. I got totally surprised. This is my personal experience of 2015. So, when I was crossing dalhousie to get sach pass. I dont even think to stop in dalhousie to have breakfast. I did my breakfast at khajjiar at local dhaba who are really rich by heart. Love the region but still hate dalhouise people. I can go on with my exprience which was bad, may be unfortunately I encountered bad people among good one's. I love himachal please stop exploiting tourist. When it comes to safety so, guys no safety make sure u have every thing for ur trip and dont get involved in any fight bcoz kind of group works there which will beat u up and u cant even complain bcoz police dont want to mess with locals",Dalhousie
"Hello to all the viewers on Mouthshut.com. I need to state that I have a very Crazy Husband and he is so fond of Long Drives and he loves to visit the Hill stations often. He follows a rule to make Plans for outing that is ""Never Make any plan and wait for the day, he says why not today""? . I still remember it was 2.30 AM on a Saturday and I heard my Husband calling my name and asking me to wake up. I was shocked why he wants me to get up so early. He just didn't tell me anything and asked me to just fresh up and pack up things. And amazingly till I was done with getting fresh he was already dressed up and back packs ready. We started at sharp 03.40 AM and till that time I was not told where we are heading to. We started from our Apartment which was at HSR Layout(Bangalore) and within 45 minutes we were at the Mysore road. I felt asleep and tucked in myself safely at the back seat. I slept the whole long way and till we reached the ghats section at the foothills of Madumalai Tiger reserve. Then I realized that we are heading towards OOTY.  Happy and amazed I jumped in to the front seat to catch the amazing view of the Dangerous Hair Pin Curves which were 36 in numbers. As he was a professional Racing driver(TURA MOUNTAIN CHALLENGE) he was just ripping along the curves and that pumped up the excitement more. We reached Ooty Town by 7 AM and then we went to get the hotel rooms booked. Any one will find so many options for stay in OOTY. We Chose Delightz Inn Resorts which is at Tiger Hill Road and is a good place safe and secure. What next was most interesting, we missed the hot water at the Hotel for a bath and hence cold water bath was the only option but after taking that we felt more comfortable. We started from the Hotel to fetch out next destination at 09.40 AM. We went to Coonoor which is at a distance of 20 KMs from Ooty. We drove though the curvy roads with Tea Plantations both side. There is a Famous Tourist Spot ""Dolphin's Nose"". There is a Hill which looks like the nose of the Dolphin and hence the name. Refreshments is available at that place and one can also purchase many items like Tea Powder, Spices and Chocolates. One the way back from Coonoor to Ooty town we stopped at a place called the Sleeping Lady Mountain. If one is lucky enough and if there is no fog one can see a line of hills resembling a Lady sleeping. By 3.45 PM we were back at Ooty town. There are many shops where in any one can find all sort of gift items and also hand woven garments. Restaurants both for the Vegetarians and the Non-Vegetarians are also available and the quality of food is also great. Tired that they we decided to take rest for the day. The very next day we started early in the morning and we headed towards Doddabetta Peak. Absolutely loved it . we stayed there for 2 hours and we loved every moment of it. You can have an Entire View of Ooty from there and it really looks mesmerizing. Then at around 10.15 Am we reached Botanical Gardens. Now this is a place where is well maintained and the greenery will make you feel really awsome. There is ample space for the kids to play around and hence also a good place for the families to visit and spend some time. After staying at the Botanical Garden for around 40 minutes we started for Pykara Dam which is around 20 kms from ooty town. That drive will also be a memory as you will be passing all the Pine trees. This Lake is far better than the Ooty Lake and here Motorized boats are also available for rides. This place also has a nice roofed area with the Tea/Coffee shops where we can sit enjoy tea and have a nice view of the lake. At around 4.30 we headed back to the Hotel, thought of spending a day more in Ooty but as I have already stated he is quiet unpredictable and hence we started back to Bangalore at 5 pm although that is not a preferable time to travel back. There is a lot more to write but time is less but Ooty is definitely a place that needs to be visited once. Its perfect for the Riders too as I see that many of the Bike riders chose it as the destination for their rides.",Ooty
"My parents and I decided to head to Ooty for 4 days in April(14th - 17th) to beat the Summer heat. I read many MS reviews on Ooty to know what to expect. I wanted to have a night journey whereas my parents wanted to travel during the day to have a nice view on the way. Finally I gave in and booked tickets for Bangalore-Ooty Volvo starting at 9.30 AM. We also booked the Rajahamsa return tickets since Volvo was full for Sunday night/evening. Journey: On April 14th, we all went to Majestic with lunch and breakfast packed in our bags. The bus started on time. The bus stopped thrice- for breakfast, lunch and tea. All the canteens were horrible n unhygenic as expected. So its better to carry your own food or snacks. A kannada and then a hindi movie(Dil Se) was played in the bus and I was amused to see two foreigners in the bus staring at TV:) Once we reached Bandipur, the journey got exciting. Everyone in the bus was up to spot animals. We spotted many deers, few elephants & some species of monkeys. After crossing Bandipur, we passed by many scenic places. A mild waft of Eucalyptus smell filled the air even though we were inside Volvo and we could feel the temperature dropping outside. The bus reached Ooty at 5.30 PM. Accomodation: We had got accomodation booked at JSS College guest house. This guest house is open only for JSS Collegians' families, but since my father knew someone there he booked it for us. The guest house is very decent, spacious and clean. There was a tv with few channels, a double bed, 2 chairs, a table, mirror stand with table, cupboard, spacious bathroom and a balcony with massive windows. It costed us only Rs. 750/day. Had we booked an accomodation with similar facilities elsewhere in Ooty, it would have costed us a minimum Rs. 1500/day. We also had breakfast and dinner on all the 3 days & 3 nights we stayed there. Food was simple and tasty. For breakfast it was dosa/idli/poha and tea/coffe. For dinner it was roti, curry, rice, rasam & butter milk. They charged Rs. 50/meal/person, but it was well worth it considering food qualtiy and cost in Ooty. Sightseeing: 1) On the first day we opted for Ooty-Conoor package by Impala Travels for Rs.125 each. It covered the following: Ketty Valley Veiw point: Here we can have a nice view of the valley beneath. We can also see through Telescope the church where Saajan movie climax was shot. They charge Rs. 5 for the Telescopic view. Singara Tea estate: The most beautiful of all the places in Ooty-Conoor. It's a huge Tea estate owned by old actress Mumtaz and her husband(lucky Fardeen:). We can take photos there in the tea-plucker's attire for Rs. 40. We can also taste Masala Tea and chocolate Tea and buy tea powder. Doddabetta Peak: This is the highest peak in south India. By the time we reached there, it was drizzling and the view was completely blocked by the cloud. It was beautiful to be amidst clouds and cool breeze. Ooty Lake: It looked very beautiful with the backdrop of massive trees, but it was stinking. So we didn't bother boating. My suggestion- Just enjoy it's beauty from a distance. Botanical Garden: Beautiful and crowded garden. It looks similar to our Bangalore's Lal Bagh. 2) On the second day we opted for Filmi Chakkar package by the same Travels because they have a pick up from our guest house. It costed Rs.125 each and covered Film-shooting spots like the following: Pine Forest: Tall Pine trees make for beautiful viewing. 9th Mile: It has a decent view to offer once we climb up the grass slopes. The grass has turned yellow and dried up now. Pykara Lake: It's dried up a bit and has boating facilities. Rose Garden: Entry ticket costs Rs.20. It did not have many roses so we did not enter. The bus also passed through spots where ""Roja"" was shot and golf club. In the evening we went to Charing Cross and shopped for some homemade chocolates. Now I had high expectations from these chocs and they did not live up to it. I bought a box each from 2 bakeries and both tasted average, much like a choc barfee! We strolled some more and had a pizza in Domino's and returned to guest house. Food: The only good food you can get in Ooty is at Hotel Nahar's 3 restaurants. I had schezwan mushroom noodles and my parents took meals and the bill was Rs. 320 and it was worth it. It is located on Charing cross road. There are many restaurants on this road but a safe bet would be to eat only at Domino's, Saravanas or one of Hotel Nahar's 3 restaurants Since we had one more day on hand, we decided to try Ooty-Conoor Toy Train but we got up late and we were not able to get tickets:) So we decided to go to Doddabetta Peak again since we could not see anything on the first day. It was a clear, sunny day and we spent a few hours at the peak and went back to our guest house. It was time to pack and leave for our 6 PM bus. It was tiime to say Goodbye:( Time to get back to our busy, city lives. The return journey was horrible coz we had got the last row seats and I felt like puking the first few hours. I guess last row seats in Ooty have a thing for my family! Also, there were some unruly school/college guys in the bus who were creating a ruckus and disturbing everyone in the bus. The bus reached Bangalore at 3 AM . Note: Please avoid Impala Travels. They made us sit in the last row seats and reserved middle seats for Tamilians. They did not allow us to sit there even after arguing. They repeated this on the second day too, but we didn't budge this time. They came late on the first day and dropped two spots viz, Catherine Falls view and Sim's Park due to lack of time and hurried us at other spots(within 10-20 mins). They stopped at ""Mahalakshmi"" for lunch which was bad and crowded because many Travels stop here for lunch. A better option would be to grab a quick bite at Cafe Coffee Day in the vicinity. All in all, I would recommend everyone to visit Ooty and Conoor once for the natural beauty, weather and fresh air. It's worth seeing only once because there are many more beautiful places in India to be explored. 3 days are good enough to cover all places. My parents had visited Ooty around 10 years ago and they felt it has become highly commercialised what with houses and lodges coming up everywhere by cutting trees all over the city. If you have the luxury of money and time, hire a car and visit all the places. This way you can stay at those places and enjoy for as long as you want.",Ooty
"Hi Guys! Today I am going to review a wonder hill station Dalhousie which is situated in Himachal Pradesh. I have visited Manali, Shimla but I like the Dalhousie is wonderful place. Its a not so much crowded like other hills station. You will find it so calm and peaceful. I visited it in month of june 2015 and the weather there is so good in morning and evening we feel a little bit dip in temprature. If you are going for atleast for 5 days than you must visit chaurasi temple, khajjiar, pachpula, must visit sach paas where you can see lots of snow even in june. While travel there yoy can see lots wonder scenic views. In 2000 to 3500₹ you can find a good hotel there. I am planning to revisit it coming  year. I also suggest you must go there and enjoy the Switzerland of India",Dalhousie
"Although every place of Himachal Pradesh is amazing and cannot be missed, so is ""Dalousie"". Its a treat for tourists because there are many beautiful places to visit. Its very easy to reach Dalhousie from anywhere in India, you can hire cabs or take buses. There are several places to visit there but most favorite place is ""Daikund Peak"" which gives you a gorgeous view to remember. If you like climbing then you can climb upto 2 Kms and you will find many good paths on your way. An other beautiful place is ""Chamera Lake"", if you love boating then this place is for you. There are several hotels out there so you can find easily a good one( if its not a peak time). There is no issue for safety, you can easily walk on street and enjoy the beauty of dalhousie without any fear.",Dalhousie
"I personally found Dalhousie to be a boring place. I visited Dalhousie on 4th November, 2017 with my family and it was not that good an experience. There is nothing much to do in Dalhousie. Also it is not a developed area, unlike other hill stations. The roads are also not in a good condition and are very narrow. Dalhousie is not the place to visit if you are coming from a far off place like Delhi or Chandigarh. There’s just one place to see in Dalhousie that is, Khajjiar, which is a large field with a little lake in the centre. The lake had already dried. So there was nothing much left for us to see. The whole trip was a complete waste of money. Guys, it is not worth visiting if you are looking for something adventurous.",Dalhousie
"If you would like to get away from Hustle bustle of the city life and enjoy nature and its purest form, then Netarhat is the Place. It has still been able to keep its virginity and simplicity intact. A range of hellocks constitutes ChotaNagpur Plateau in Palamu, Jharkhand and Netarhat is the Queen of them all. The place is still predominantly a tribal area and people here have agricultural, mining labour, and handicraft as their livelihood.It is around 250 km from Ranchi, capital of new state Jharkhand and takes about 4 and half hours in bus. Private car can be hired as well to reach Netarhat. Betla forest is about 150 kilometres from Netarhat.Only Few hotels are available. However, in my opinion,  it is better to book them in advance, before arriving at the Netarhat. Some small restaurants are also available. But besides all these factors the Place is not at all safe which insist me to rate this amazing place as average. You cannot dare to take your own vehical roads are not well built.All the way it's an average  place to hangout with friends or with family. Moreover Don't forget to visit sunset point to enjoy the beauty of nature.",Netarhat
Friends I went to visit dalhousie with my friends . Friends I did not like this hill station at all. The roads in this Hill station are very much broken The hotels here also do not provide good facilities and see very expensive The name of this hill station is the name and nothing to see There is nothing besides seeing the snow here the vehicle facility is not quite good It is very dirty and rotten The dirty in dalhousie hill station is very much cleaned and not cleaned Traffic is very high here There is also fear of stolen goods in the hotels here. Here there is only a lake which in the palm. Friends have to spoil the money to go away here.,Dalhousie
Hey frnds I am back for sharing my experience on Hill station on Netarhat.Netarhat is city Lather district in Indian state Jharkhand. that place is not safe there is not proper hot lel facility who are come from cars and their vanes  .they should sleep in their vehicles because of insecurity. this is not safe for childrens and their is no arrangment of police station thsats it is very dangerous. that place is like as jungle there was a waterfall but did't sweem in it if any one slip he fall on deep water so it was very dangrous and unsafe I suggest dont visit that place because there ia no thing to see,Netarhat
This is good place to trravel long destination from ranchi it is situated in latehar state jharkhand it is best site for picnic in there a great point of view of sunrise or sunset it look very beautiful and charming pepole all around from india came to see the sunrise or sunset and also god of workship there is a good site of valley in travelling there is a dam and good place to celebrate a picnic it takes 6 hours from the ranchi where a great famous school is situated name netarhat which produce jharkhand academic counciling it is a naxalwad area but do not hurt tourist herw a deep forest which make people charming to see a beautiful forest.,Netarhat
"In last winter I with my some friends visited Netarhat, Jharkhand. It is the place of extreme Natural Beauty. It was very pleasant for visiting. But there is so many problem if you go with your family. Because Netarhat is a place of Mouist redder. That's why till this place is not safe for the Visitors. This place may be dangerous in nights. There are few villages in there but all are in forest so Every time I feel a loneliness. There is a problem with Hotels. Only 2 hotels we found in Netarhat. So in winter season many visitors didn't get Hotel in this place. Otherwise there are many water falls in Netarhat which is very Beautiful. That's all about Netarhat.",Netarhat
"It is a beautiful place to visit for adventure junkees, but for me I felt bit uncomfortable there because it was far from city and around that place I spotted only few shops and two hotels, but the waterfalls out there made my day although the place was slippery and not safe for childrens. Accessibility at the place was not so good because it was far from city and the small shops there had no products which I needed. Local sightseeing was good as the place had many waterfalls and there is no restrictions out there so we can go down to the waterfall and swim out there, but it is a risky place for the people who dont know to swim because if we slip there then we will fall directly inside the water. Hotels and accomodations are limited when I went there, I spotted ony two hotels, not sure if more was there and the facilities in the hotles are not upto the mark, but considering the forests around the hotles were good, the water facilities and electricity was 24 hrs active, but we had to compromise on food, as they had a limited menu, we can only order from the available items. As per safety measures in that place I dont think it was fully secure for a tourists to feel free, before reaching there few peoples were talking about the theifs who stollen the items of tourists, but we did not experience such things there and the waterfalls was not safe, which is our responsibility to stay as much away as possible and enjoy the beauty of nature from far.",Netarhat
Netarhat is the tourist place present in jharkhand. This place is present in Latehar district of jharkhand which is about 40 km from Latehar main town and approximately 140 km from ranchi.it is the place where always feel like cold and people can enjoy be seeing sun nearest to their front. Netarhat is popular for nearest sun rising and cold place of jharkhand. There have series of hills that make it attractive. A netarhat school present their which is famous in jharkhand. Netarhat is really a tourist place,Netarhat
"Me and my friends visited Dalhousie in 2016.We were enchanted with the green lush vegetation and the mesmerizing view of the Himalayas.We stayed in Dalhousie for 2 days and in this 2 days we hired a taxi to visit Khajjar(mini Switzerland), Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary, Dainkund, and many more.Walking on the streets of dalhousie features the surrounding beauty of the hill station.Most of the restaurants and eatery are present in the Gandhi Chowk which is in heart of the city.",Dalhousie
Before 2months I have visited to this place so on behalf of my personal experience I would like to share with you as a review. There is no good accessibility in this place and it is very dangerous place. When we talk about the local sightseeing it is a little bit nice but not so amazing as you could expect because we can't see sunrise properly here. The main problem is there is no proper hotel facility usually peoples who come with their car & Van they should sleep inside only because of insecurency of the place. This place is very dangerous and not so secured there is no proper police station near this place. So by observing of these things I would like to suggest you all please don't go here because it is a very dangerous place.,Netarhat
"I am going to share my experience about this hill station. It is a place to visit in all the month of the year. But I prefared summer. Netherhat is a city in Latehar district of the Indian state of Jharkhand. Referring to the queen of chhota Nagpura, it is a popular hill station. The first thing you should do is not to forget to see the sunrise early in the morning. Once you refresh, you can spend the rest of the day in the different waterfalls. In the evening, make a point to give Magnolia Point, which is ten kilometers away from Netarhat, to give a testimony to the spectacular sun. Yo can pass your time in nature or visit the places like Netherhat School and the Netarhat Dam. Neharhat is a plateau region and there is not much in terms of food. Around this area, small restaurants generally mix Bihari and Bengali dishes. Hotel facility is not available here. One or two small hotels are available which are always crowd and rooms are not available. No hospital as well as Police station available near it. So this place is not good in security prurpose. Like and comment on above review.",Netarhat
"Hello friends , I am giving review and my true experience on Netarhat a place where no facility available for our safety .Anytime , anything can happen .There is no hotel facility to stay their and enjoy lonh time , no police station near Netarhat for help and support .This is a open place sourrounded with so many long trees. Wild animals also come their anytime and give harm to us.No guard their for guide and help in night.Also main thing is tha no proper sunshine can see . Accessibility is very far from my region and this is one side place , their is noone near this place. Local sightseeing is also bad.Only trees are their to see only in day time.No sunshine can see because of so many trees. Hotels / accomodations , ni hotels their for stay in night.one who go with their cars they can stay and sleep . No safety facility their for visitors , no guard in night and propers instructions , no police station near .",Netarhat
"I visited this beautiful place with my family. Speciality of netarhat(known as choranagpur) is the beautiful sunrise and sunset views.we enjoyed here because it is a place which filled with natural beauty.we enjoyed sunset at magonilla point which is an amazing plays for sunset views.there are lots of water falls here. Availability of chemist shops are very poor.this makes difficulties to the people who came here without medicines.we suffered lot. Availability of accommodation is average and netarhat is not linked with other important cities. In my opinion, it is not a safe place to visit because maoist threats are existing here. It is a perfect place to enjoy the natural beauty but not a safe place! Thank you",Netarhat
"Nothing to see their Only the thing to see is khajiyaar which is some km away from it better than dalhousie Khajiyaar has a big area . A green ground And a place covered with tall trees and their is also skydiving So my advice is to say no to dalhousie it has nothing to see only a waste of time So, visit anywhere else rather than it",Dalhousie
"I would like to share my personal experience with Netarhat, the tourism place. I went their with my friends 2 weeks ago. We went their for a tour. We reached there at 7 a.m.  I was excited to see that place because my friends tells me that this place has s natural beauty and looks very beautiful. When we reached there, we looked for a hotel because we were staying there for 3 days as planned But there were shortage of hotels and this place is far from city. We found only two hotels there and they charged a lot. But we needed a hotel so we paid xtra money. When we went out to see that place after taking rest in hotel, I found that it is not beautiful as my friends told me. This place is like a jungle . there was no thing which can we see. There was a waterfall but we didn't swim out as if anyone slips from there he fell into deep water. This place is not suitable for children as they are not safe there. I suggest that not to visit this place bacause there is no thing to see like.",Netarhat
"I am will impart my experience to this slope station. It is a place to visit in all the long stretch of the year. In any case, I favored summer. Netherhall is a city in Latehar locale of the Indian territory of Jharkhand. Alluding to the ruler of Chhota Nagpur, it is a well-known slope station. The principal thing you ought to do isn't to neglect to see the dawn at a young hour early in the day. When you revive, you can spend whatever remains of the day in the distinctive waterfalls. At night, influence a point to offer Magnolia To point, which is ten kilometers far from Netarhat, to give a declaration to the marvelous sun. You can take a break in nature or visit the spots like Netherhall School and the Netarhat Dam. Neharhat is a level area and there isn't much regarding nourishment. Around this territory, little eateries for the most part blend Bihari and Bengali dishes. Lodging office isn't accessible here. Maybe a couple little inns are accessible which are dependably group and rooms are not accessible. No healing center and also Police station accessible close it. So this place isn't great insecurity reason. Like and remark on above audit.",Netarhat
"I have visited Dalhousie last months with my family.  I have gone their from New Delhi, by train, the nearest railways station is Pathankot from where I take private taxi for reaching Dalhousie.  I arrived their in the evening where I have already booked a hotel there which provide us very good and comfortable room and there was also a restaurant on the roof of the hotel, I enjoyed there very much.  The weather of Dalhousie was very cold and on the same night there was a nice snow fall started.  When we wake up in the morning all the hotels, roads and greenery of nearby covered with full of white snow.  The weather becomes very romantic and pleasant. I enjoyed the snow fall there very much.  I have stayed there four days.  I visited the places of interest like Dainkund Peak, Khajjiar, Dalhousie cantonment, Punchpula, Tibetan Market and thereby local market. This place was less populated and rare township.  There was greenery and forests all over the town.  The view of this place during snowfall is very attractive and enjoyable. Whereas I think this place is very special for honeymoon couples as the place is very calm and romantic.  On that time many honeymoon couples are stayed and moving all over this place. I am giving some details of Dalhousie and Kajjiar for information of the person who is making plan to visit this place.  Dalhousie is a hill station in Chamba district in the state of Himachal Pradesh.  This town was named after Lord Dalhousie, who was the British Governor – General in India and it was established as a summer retreat for its troops and officials.  The best time to visit this place is summer(May to September). Khajjiar is located approx 24 km from Dalhousie.  This is surrounded by meadows and forests.  It can be reached within one and half hour from Dalhousie.  It has a rare combination of three ecosystems – lake, pasture and forest.  Its nickname is Mini Switzerland of India. It is very important to note that whenever we visit Dalhousie, Khajjihar must visit. Without visiting of Kajjihar the trip of Dalhousie is incomplete. I have hired a taxi from Dalhusie to Kajjihar and reached there after one and half hour, the seen of Khajjihar is the awesome.  There was snow fall all over the place there. The view was amazing.  The trip was very exiting and interesting I strongly recommend all the lover of visiting interesting tourist places must visit the place.",Dalhousie

"Everybody love hill stations, so do I came to know about Netarhat in Jharkhand. It is famous for the sunrises and sunsets in summers as it is located on a plateau.  Also, the place felt quite small due to fewer places of tourist interests, being Magnolia Point known for sunset; Upper and Lower Ghaghri Falls, Lodh and Sadni Falls and also Koel View Point. Among which Lodh(around 60 km)  and Sadni Falls(around 40 km) are a little far from Netarhat( but not far enough for an enthusiastic traveler). These were the Pros of the place but as an individual, the most important thing is safety, which not good in Netarhat. The accessibility in the place is not well structured and one might find issues traveling safely. The population seems minimal while traveling and Local sightseeing doesn't offer more than some dense forest with a lot of oxygen as the gift. Accommodating yourself might go from acceptable to even difficult situations. As far as safety is regarded you could not expect much(As the place has a bad reputation). As a Tourist, I would only suggest others that do a good research, plan your accommodation and travel, and also be aware what are signing up for before going to this place. Thanks!",Netarhat

"Srirangam Srirangam, 7 km from Trichy (Tamil Nadu) is an island (actually islet) town known for its Temple of Sri Ranganathswamy steeped in rich history and culture. It is considered to be the first of 108 Vaishanava Temples also sometimes called Booloka Vaikuntam (earthly paradise). The Srirangam Temple is said to be modeled after the Sri Vaikuntam of Vishnu mentioned in the Vedas. The River Kaveri known as Perenial River (though a few years ago looked arid – at present flooded) is a great tourist attraction – Kollidam – a branch of Kaveri is very near to the temple – near to my home too. : This temple complex is 156 acres in extent, having seven enclosures (prakaras) similar to the seven gates of paradise. All these prakaras are enclosed by huge walls – supposedly built by Thirumangiaalwar – a devotee of Lord Ranganatha. The Raja Gopuram which is 236 feet high and the gold Vimana is a magnificent sight. The Lord is in reclining position over the serpent (Adi Sheshan) bed. Everyday one sees a throng of devotees standing in line to have a darshan of the Lord. Adjacent to the temple of the Lord is the temple of Ranganayaki Thayar (Goddess Lakshmi) and all around the temple there are numerous small temples (sannadhi) of Lord Rama, Krishna, Srinivasa and many more. Lord Ranganatha has been celebrated by all the 12 Alwars (prime devotees) in various hymns like Naalaiyara Divyaprabandham and so its importance. : It is said that Vibheeshana carried Lord Ranganatha (Lord’s Idol given to him by Shri Rama) during the treta yugam to safeguard his place- present day Srilanka on a condition that he should not keep it down until he reaches his country. But Vibheeshana while taking bath gives the shrine to the boy  and the boy unable to bear the weight keeps it down (the boy is supposed to be Lord Ganesha). The place where the Idol is kept is known as Srirangam – the Lord Ranganatha promises Vibheeshana that he will take care of his country from the very place – So the Lord is Facing South –exactly Sri Lanka. The little Lord Ganesha ran away from Vibheeshana and sat on the top of a rock – hill – now known as Uchi Pillayar Kovil, the Rock Temple. The Cholas and Pallavas (dynasties that ruled Trichy) has largely contributed to the growth of the temple -inscriptions can be found on the temple walls. There are so many legends surrounding Srirangam - since I do not have space I have mentioned only the most popularly believed legend. : In the early morning there is Vishwarupa darshan (Rs 50/- per person has to be paid) and after that Free darshan is allowed. They also give ticket pass (yearly), which costs Rs 6000/- Other details can be found in the website : This is a small temple nearby Kollidam and very near to the temple of Srirangam celebrating the glory of The Ten Avatars of Lord Vishnu (All ten shrines are found here –the main deity of the temple is Lord Narasimha. As regards to the origin very little is known about this temple. : Other attractions nearby Srirangam are Thiruvanyakaval Kovil (Lord Siva Temple) and the Rock Temple and St Lourdes Church in Trichy. There are couple of lodges in Srirangam offering rooms in affordable rates for devotees from far-off.",Srirangam
"This is the largest Hindu temple located in Trichi, Tamil Nadu. I have visited this temple once last year. It is widely known that the area of this temple is larger than the entire area of Vatican City. Hence this temple is larger than the smallest country of the world, then imagine the area of this temple. This temple is located on a island formed by the ancient river of Kaveri. This river was sung by ancient Tamil literatures  like Silappadhikaram. There is a Mandapam in this temple, where Kambar showcased his epic Kambaramayanam. It is a must visit for those who go to this temple. There are seven compunds for this temple enclosing more than 160 acres of land. Lord Vishnu is the main god. If you visit the temple during the Tamil month of Margalzi, you will get an everlasting memories of early morning worships. The age of temple is around 800 years and is still in full functioning state. This temple is easily reachable by road, train and air.",Srirangam

"Srirangam, Ranganatha Swamy temple is one among the 3 Rangnatha kshethras in India. The Gopuram is the biggest in India and the temple is very vast and huge. It is just 15 kilometers from the city of Tiruchirapalli and is easily accessible. The temple architecture is awesome and 7 doors or gopurams lead you to the Shrine of Shri Ranganatha. Devotees are allowed to have a close look at the shrine and the Darshan would take around 2 hours. The temple remains closed from 12.30 PM to 5.30 PM. The shrine of goddess Lakshmi / Thayaru is located at the back of the sanctum sanctorum. As the temple is vast it takes time to walk through all the upalayas and would definitely require quite an effort. We will find many stay options in Trichy and also in Srirangam. Near to Srirangam is another must visit temple, the Jambukeswara temple. It is an ancient temple of lord Shiva where the lord is said to be in the form of'Jala Linga'. Best time to visit would be from August to February and the place is well connected by road and railways.",Srirangam

"Visiting Srirangam is like stepping back in time, by centuries.  Srirangam is an island between the Coleroun and CAuvery Rivers just before Trichy.   The main temple here is the ancient Sri Ranganathaswamy temple of Maha Vishnu.  It is set in seven concentric rectangular enclosures with 23 Gopuram towers.  The most recent Rajagopuram is the tallest temple tower in the world. The outer enclosures are markets, residences etc.  The religious zone commences from the fourth enclosure with the Sri Vimanam being the sanctum sanctorum in the first enclosure.  The temple dates back to ancient times with references to Ranganathaswamy made in Sangam period Tamil literature.  It is best to engage a guide from the shoe deposit counter just outside the fourth enclosure, otherwise you will be walking around aimlessly without getting a proper opportunity to appreciate the place.  The sculptures, pillars, columns and frescoes are magnificent. The most famous being the famous Srirangam Horses which are a series of eight exquisitely carved columns of horses in battle.  No two sculptures in this complex are alike.  For photographers, it is a case of going berserk, so take along extra batteries and memory cards.  Hotels are limited, mostly being of the lodge type, there are Sri Rengaa and Maruthi lodge close by which also have small ac rooms with attached bath.  For better hotels, one can stay at Trichy but staying at Srirangam itself is more convenient as you can make an early start.  Check srirangam.org for more details as well as srirangam.info Give yourself at least four hours to see the temple well, plus extra time if you want a darshan.  For Vaishnavaites, this is supposed to be the holiest of temples. There is also a Jambukeswara temple of Lord Shiva in Srirangam which is also ancient and worth a visit.  The unique feature is that the Sivalingam is always submerged.",Srirangam

"Hello friends , I m back again , Today I m taking about my experince Netarhat, as well you konw that this isnot safe . It is a place to visit in all the month of the year. But l prefared summer. Netherhat is a city in Latehar district of the Indian state of Jharkhand. Referring to the queen of chhota Nagpura, it is a popular hill station. The first thing you should do is not to forget to see the sunrise early in the morning. Once you refresh, you can spend the rest of the day in the different waterfalls.The main problem is there is no proper hotel facility usually peoples who come with their car & Van they should sleep inside only because of insecurency of the place. This place is very dangerous and not so secured there is no proper police station near this place. So would like don't go here because dangerous place.so I must say that plz dont go this hill station .",Netarhat
"Last year we had a bike ride from ranchi to netarhat which was roughly close to 150 km from my place.I was living in Jharkund during that times.A range of hillocks constitute the chotanagpur plateau , and Netahat is the queen of them all.The place is still predominantly a tribal area and people here are engaged in farming and mining.Now let me say about the worst part of my experience.The drive to the place is painful.The road is broken down all along and the place  is very dirty.The safety of us stands at risk during our entire journey.The road is covered with mist which makes the road a dangerous place to be.The government roads does not have security baricades on the sides to prevent vehicles from falling down from the top.The travelling is very dangerous and risky to cummit.If any of as get in an accident here it would take hours to get help.On reaching the destination , government guest house is available  for stay.The jungle is so close by.There are threats from dangerous animals from the forest in the place.Thank god we didnt have such incidents.Above that the place is an absolute beaty where gods hand touches the Earth.",Netarhat
"One of the best monument and architecture of the world. just 70 km from the capital of ODISHA it's easily reachable withing 2-3 hours by public transport. The construction of the temple is really out of box, it contains single single stones of weight more than 1000 tones. Thickness of the wall of temple is 15-30 feet, Micro architecture on the walls are best among any where in the world. It was attacked by kala pahad an old king, and he damaged huge parts of the temple and in 1920 the british people put sand inside the temple to save it from any further damage. So It's closed from inside, you can only see the outside sculpture and roam around. The statue of SUN is taken away from here. Big big statue made from stone of ""MUGUNI"" are exclusive here so it's also called as black pagoda. Photography is allowed, best time to visit is in sun rise time. So took a professional photographer or a good camera while visiting. Take help of guide to take proper information.",Konark

"Konark temple popularly called sun temple of India. People say the lights from this temple at night can be viewed from the space. It’s almost 1000years old. Langula Narasing Dev, King of Orissa created this. Many peoples were died at that period. For completion of this temple, king Narasing took around 12years. You can find great pictures arround the temple. Its only 90km from Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa and 30km from Puri, Lord Jagannath Temple. You can take the help of any travel agency or can take the bus directly to konark. In the way you can find the Chilika Lake (India's largest Salty Lake and great attraction). Here in konark you can find another holy sea beach called Chandrabhaga. People say if you take bath only once in chandrabhaga it’s equal to 10times in Ganga. It’s really a nice place.

"I know that it will be very funny  if  I begin to tell ambitiously about Konarak Temple; because it is not the only wonderful temple that India has….  India (especially Tamil Nadu State) is famous for its temples.   But unfortunately, everybody doesn’t know about it. There are some temple types in Indian Architecture and Konarak Sun Temple is one of the examples of the same style seen in some places. So, after seeing others, I will have the chance to choose my best amongst all of them. But as I couldn’t  see the others, now I can talk about Konarak as I wish. When I first saw the temple, I was shocked! Because, until that time, I didn’t know that such a temple was there in any place having beautiful ornamentations, sculptures, lace like carvings… and the mythology, literature, stories were told in the same place altogether…  every sculpture, even erotical ones has a concept and the temple completely attracts person…(When you search on net, you see the architectural value, no need to mention it here again) I just thought,   “in four years education of architecture, I was only taught about Europian buildings and about my country.  Why was I deprived of the knowledge of temples in India? Which construction  was there in Europe more attractive and perfect than this temple? Why was only Taj Mahal is known in my country and temples aren’t heard?”  With these deep opinions, my admiration increased…I thought it like a pearl in a mussel… it is not known like Eiffel in Paris, but is more valuable; an art masterpiece… Your eyes aren’t wrong; the things you see are real… You want to go back to the date the temple was being built so that you can believe it is human made by seeing the masters while working and carving. Because you hardly believe that it is not a dream what you see.  It is certainly magical…",Konark

"Konark is an amazing sun temple which is the site of the 13th-century and it is built in about 1250 AD by Eastern Ganga empire king Narasimhadeva. It is a one of the famous tourist place in Orissa. I have visited that temple more than 3 times. It is formed like a monster chariot, the sanctuary is known for the lovely stone carvings that cover the whole structure. It took 12000 craftsmen 12 long years to build this extraordinary structure. Konark was sacked by the Muslim Yavana armed(Kala Pahar) force in the fifteenth century. The focal statue revered in the sanctuary was snuck away to Puri by clerics; however the Sun Temple was severely harmed in the assault. You can visit sun temple throughout the year. The stay in adjacent town like Bhubaneswar and Puri is economical. There are a few spots inside of 50 Km. of this spot to visit. I advise everyone to visit this awesome place once in your life time.",Konark

"Badrinath is the very holy place of hinduism. It is the temple of god vishnu. Badrinath is also known as Badrinarayan. Now I am sharing my true experience with my trip. Well I usually go to Badrinath every year to worship as well as for refreshment. Each and every trip results to adventure as well as awesomeness either its with my family or friends. The nature scenes where it is located and the weather is beyond my imagination you cannot prejudge the fun going there without actually experiencing it. Badrinath is located at height of 3100 m above sea level approx. It is surrounded by peaks of around 6.5 km height which seams as a plain wallpaper when seen(means you can't just calculate it). If you want some adventure either by 2 or 3 wheeler, the actual adventurous path starts from joshimath(a town 50 km before badrinath) to your destination. The steepest mountains with narrowest valleys is to be traveled. Badrinath is best place for experiencing positivity inside as well as purifying your soul. Whenever I go to Badrinath, I just find myself feeling pleasure as well as light minded that I can't explain it. Actually I am devoted that is why I feel so pleasant here. The nature surrounded, the cold weather irrespective of month of year, the blessing of god vishnu, everything here makes this place a heaven. If you are spiritual then you will feel what am talking about when come here. There are many holy places to worship situated at Badrinath as well as other sight seeing and tourist places like- 1.Mana village- It is the last Indian village before the border of china and Uttarakhand.  many holy places are here like bheem pul( a bridge made bu bhim when Pandava were to cross Saraswati nadi, Dropadi temple(where Dropadi died during pandava yatra to heaven), Ganesh gufa(a cave where lord Ganesh had written Mahabharata) etc. the character, lifestyle and embroidery work Mana people is pleasant, simple and good. The yatra of satopanth swargarohini starts from Badrinath. this yatra is said to most holy yatra and adventurous too. The flow of Alaknanda  river is so turbulent and many glaciers lies in this route. Badrinath is usually close for six months a year due to cold climate(mid November to May) no one lives in Badrinath in this period except the Army and some devoted man. the best time to go to Badrinath is June or mid October as the rainfall is less in these month. The way to Badrinath is quiet dangerous so driving should very careful. there are much more things and beauty and I fully recommend to visit and worship here, and I am sure you'll find pleasure here. Jai Badrinarayan!",Badrinath
I visited Badrinath in June 2017 and my route to badrinath is delhi - haridwar - rishikesh - joshhimath - badrinath.  My mode of conveyance is my friend's car.

Next day morning we proceeded to badrinath via rudra prayag - dev prayag -srinagar - pauri garhwal - tehri garhwal and reached joshimath where we stayed in Garhwal mandal guest house. Next morning we reached badrinath and then proceeded to phoolon ki ghati and gurudwara hemkunt sahib. All the route is safe as arrangements made by Uttarakhand government.

"Recently me and my family toured Chardham Yatra.  At Badrinath, our accommodation was arranged at ANANTHA MUTT [belongs to Pejavar Mutt]. I strongly suggest not seek any accommodation facility at this place as the room provided to us was so dirty and uncleaned.  I don't it has ever been cleaned up.  the carpets were torn and full of dust.  The walls were peeling off.  The Razzai provided to us were torn and had bad smell and was in wet condition when the temperature was 1 degree or less.  There is no hot water facility.  The windows were so dirty, you can not even touch.  The hotel managers are not bothered if you try to complain.  I think, the tourism department must conduct inspection regularly at these places and should not allow them continue with this business any more. If any of you have booked for accommodation, please verify before you land up there.",Badrinath

The whole sanctuary was composed fit as a fiddle of an enormous chariot, conveying the sun god, Surya, over the heavens.Each and each segment of the sanctuary is secured with figures of gods, heavenly and human artists, artists fanciful animals mixed with models of winged creatures and animals.The sanctuary is Famous for suggestive figures it runs at standard with models found in Ajanta and Ellora.The huge structure, now in vestiges, sits in lone magnificence encompassed by floating sand. Today it is found 2 kilometers from the ocean, however initially the sea came nearly up to its base.

"At first instance, you will see the city is calm and quiet ! Actually it is ! It's one of the most leavable city in Maharashtra ! The life in city called Aurangabad is slow, steady and healthy ! In early start of the 21st century, Aurangabad was the fastest developing city in Asia. But later the pace simply slowed down like anything and now it is no where in developing list ! A capital of marathwada, city of 52 gates ( not sure how many still there) , city of copy of one of the seven wonders of world ( Taj Mahal - Biwi ka Maqbara) , City of home of many historic places ( Pan Chakki,  Ellora, Buddha caves,  Soneri  Mahal etc) and forts, Host of most visited caves in the world ( Ajanta) , City where Dr. B. R. Ambedkar spent most of his time and started many educational institutions, City of famous temples ( Ghrushneshwar) , City of having reputation of being good host, City of business class people, last but now a topic of chat , a city where Mr. Captain Cool Dhoni visited her wife ( girl friend that time) . The only thing Aurangabad is lacking in worst transport infrastructure. The major reason is not having a good leadership to represent at high level. Else Aurangabad would have been among best metropolitan cities like Pune, Nagpur. If you reading this review for having information about visit, Aurangabad will not let you down. It's cute historic city. Just go for it !",Aurangabad

I have visited badrinath temple once. If you are a teen and going for a trip then it is a bad place for you. I aint a very religious person so there is nothing there for me this place except for natural beauty has nothing more to offer you Only thing you could do here is pray and visit temple and the shops also don't offer much . The food was terible and there were not much choice also. So if you are looking for a adventurous trip then this is not a place for you to visit. If you are a very religious person and love artifacts then only you should consider visiting this place.,Badrinath

"Lakshadweep is a tiny union territory of India that we hold on to for political and defence reasons, even though it costs us a whopping 300 crores a year to do so. But even if that was'nt so, its worth it for the beauty alone. I think I can safely say its a glimpse of paradise on earth. It has pristine beaches, the sand is white and feels like silk, because its more coral powder than sand, they tell me. The entire beach is littered with beautiful corals but don't even think of bringing away any, its forbidden. KAVARATTI-its the capital of Lakshadweep.How to get there....from Cochin you can take a flight to Agatti(and back) in a Dornier aircraft, seats 17, from where Kavaratti is a two hour boat ride, or you can fly the direct Cochin-Kavaratti helicopter service which is faster and takes you there in two hours, albeit the ride is hot and leaves you queasy. But its fast and saves time. The boat from Cochin to Kavaratti does a overnight journey. Activities-- Kavaratti has a small museum and aquarium that house the most incredible fish I have ever seen.They also have glass bottomed boats that show you awesome sights of life in the ocean.If you're lucky, you may even see dolphin.I saw one faaar away in the distance, or so my boatman insisted.If you're really lucky, they sometimes swim close to the island and exhibit some synchronized swimming in groups of ten or more.The island is secluded and its almost totally cut off from the mainland.Its like time stopped there. From Kavaratti, the gorgeous BANGARAM island is just 30 minutes away by chopper. Bangaram is FABULOUS, with its coral reefs and blue lagoons, its got scuba diving, snorkelling and other water sports.Its a huge international attraction, but its also pricey at 24000 INR a day.The beach is clean and unlittered the likes of which I have never seen before.The locals tell me the Maldives are similar but far more crowded.The lagoon waters are so crystal clear, you can read a letter through them.The coral reefs are huge, growing like trees in some places and the fishes are in technicolor (eat your heart out nat geo).The water is turquoise blue, the lagoon is the color of the loveliest green. If you do take the chopper, I promise you a sight you will never forget, of the blue - green ocean with waters through which the corals are clearly visible, and the island covered with a carpet of lush greenery, every inch of it, even the sky's bluer as there is zero pollution.But you will need a permit to visit, usually obtained within 15 days.AGATTI is much the same, a 15 min helicopter ride from Kavaratti.ALL beautiful, clear and clean beaches, friendly people...one thing that struck me was...nobody hounds you to buy this and sample that.They just let you be, the aggressive selling of the tourist touts is non-existent here.The beaches are exclusive, theres no crowd...that's right, no crowd, just spaces of empty beaches and coconut trees and tropical paradise.There's no shopping to be done here, only speciality is a type of tuna fish pickle you may enjoy.The food is good and if you like fish you're in for a treat.Its so serene and the only sound is birdsong and the whispering of the ocean.When compared to the beaches of Lakshadweep, Goa seems so commercialised and crowded, over hyped is the word that comes to mind, with the rowdy crowds and locals bending backwards to please the foreigners and shortchanging the rest. The beaches of Goa are passable, the sea a dirty grey, yet its the marketing that has made it a star, and a totally undeserving one too.By contrast, Lakshadweep is paradise, ..PARADISE!!...I guess they prefer classes rather than masses, I pray they keep it this way. Spend time lazing in the sun by the lagoons, and time will slowly spin out and stop. Don't forget to bring along sunscreen, and be warned- the humidity levels are pretty high. And book your seats well in advance as availability is limited.Btw, Bangaram has a total capacity of holding 120-130 people, half of whom are island staff.That means the island maxes out on 60 odd tourists.This is the reason for the high prices, and the feeling you're on your own private beach.There are very few cottages and they're snapped up by both indians and foreigners in the blink of an eye, so make sure you book well in advance.                   P.S.we saw a gorgeous red full moon rising over the ocean(ARABIAN SEA actually)ant its an unforgettable sight.",Lakshadweep
Situated on the river ganga in rishikesh this bridge vibrates very much due to the traffic on it and due to its structure i.e. it is not supported on pillars. One side of the bridge has Ashrams around. And the view from there is very much good. And the peacefulness of the place is quite good. One can meditate along the shore of the mother ganga. The ganga aarti is also a good spot to watch over there and bring ur mind to calmness.,Ram Jhula
"Hello friends, I had gone to Rishikesh 3years ago.I went there with my wife because We have some work ht Haridwar.Rishikesh is situated near Haridwar at a distance about 25KM.We want to watch Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula. Sightseeing- Rishikesh is a beautiful place.Ram Jhuka and Laxman Jhula both are parallel bridge over river Ganga.This jhula is made by iron rope.This is a crowdy place.There are many seller available.Rafting in river Ganga is a good sight to see from Ram Jhoola. Hotel- There are some small hotels and lodges available.we were stay in Haridwar and just watching Ram Jhula we arrived there. Safety- I think that Ram Jhula is a safe place if you safe yourself by local cheaters.But we have to be careful. Cleanliness- Ram Jhula is not a clean place, because it is open for man, animals and two wheelers .There are much dirt on this Jhula.Utterakhand Government have to take step to clean this place because this is a tourist place.",Ram Jhula
"After spending 27 yrs of my life I can tell you that this is the best place to live, it has its own plus and minus. Since I was residing here I will take you to the tour of Baroda from a resident's perspective. This may not be exact travelogue but will give you people enough opportunities to explore Baroda. Baroda, popularly known as Vadodara because of its abundance of banyan trees once upon a time (not any more though). Baroda today is considered city of education and henceforth ''Sanskar Nagri (Cultured City)'' How to reach there: Baroda is easily accessible by train, road or air. It is roughly 500 kms from Mumbai and 100kms from Ahmedabad. When to visit: Vadodara is extremely hot in summer so I advise you to stay away during summer but winter season is the best season particularly September to March and this is the season of festivals. People: People are friendly, most of them Gujaratis, who are known for their generous nature and hospitality but City has become attraction of many non Gujaratis from different part of country who have decided to settle permanently mainly because of its vibrant economy, decent population, good education and great festivals. Now a day essentially the crowd is cosmopolitan. Places to live: There is abundance of accommodation available which range from cheap to luxurious. I was resident of Baroda so I never had to stay in hotel so can not give much detail. Places to visit: In order of preference: 1) EME temple: This temple is maintained by EME (Electrical and Mechanical Engineering) corps of army. This temple is beautiful built of Aluminum only, extremely well maintained with nice surrounding garden. It has very nice idol of Dakshinamurty (Shiva). This place is worth visiting due to its peaceful nature. I have spent many evenings here when I thought I needed to talk to myself. 2) Sayaji Park (Kamatibaug): Located in the heart of city is amazing garden created in the era of Gaekwads, is still the largest park in the city and has multiple attractions which include Zoo, Garden itself, Planetarium, Milk bar (particularly Dahiwada are popular here) and toy train with mini railway station(on the verge of closing down or closed already). Lots of attractions have closed down and I am really sad about it. When I was young zoo was free and we could just spend some of the summer afternoons watching those incredible animals. There were two merry go rounds near the banks of river in garden. Sadly now a days river is either dry or carry polluted water. Most memorable are Sunday evenings near bandstand in the garden, which is kind of center of the park where on Sunday evenings they play nostalgic hits most of them of RK's and particularly if it is full moonlight you can really enjoy moments. With increasing population now park seems more crowded than ever but still it is one of the best. 3) Laxmivilas palace: Designed in Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, the palace built by Maharaja Sayajirao 111 in 1890 is till date the residence of the Royal family. Its ornate Darbar Hall has an Italian mosaic floor and walls with mosaic decorations. This Darbar Hall has been place of lots of concerts of great classical music maestros. 4) Ajwa-Nimeta Gardens: This is located near Ajwa Lake which supplies most of the water to Baroda. The garden is based on famous Vrindavan Garden of Mysore and it is good retreat about 30-35 kms from Baroda and also has couple of waterparks near it. 5) M.S. University of Baroda: This itself is an amazing place and shows how much devoted the ruler was towards education. This is the only University in Baroda and is housing various faculties which include Arts, Science, Engineering, Medicine etc. 6) Sri Aurobindo Ashram: This was founded by Maharshi Aurobindo is a center for spiritual activity and is best place to meditate. 7) KirtiMandir: Meaning 'Hall of Fame', it's a memorial for the Gaekwad rulers. Designed in the Hindu style, it is a magnificent stone building with domes, terraces, balconies and a central shikhara. It is decorated with murals by the famous Indian artist, Nandlal Bose. 8) Kashi-Vishwanath Temple: This temple is located on Rajmahal road is another place which I love. Besides these places there are lots of other temples and very beautiful jain derasars in almost each area of the city. There are so many other places, Baroda is kind of divided between old Baroda which is between 4 gates and was main shopping area for years and I still love it. You have to go there either by two wheeler or walk in because it is always crowded but I like it as many of my memories attached to this place. New shopping area is Alkapuri which houses major shopping complexes and good hotels. Safety: This is probably the safest city in entire India a girl can drive kinetic after Dandia raas at 3 or 4 am and can reach home safely. This to my knowledge does not happen anywhere in the country except Gujarat. Lots of my non gujju friends told me that they have never seen any other place as safe as Baroda. Where to eat: I left Baroda in 1997 for better prospects in USA and visited in 2002 and made a point to come back every year since then. Besides family most important things which I missed was local food and festivals. Barodians love food. There are plenty of Hotels and outlets which are good to satisfy any taste. Few important ones which I like and I am pure vegetarian so sorry for those folks who eat non-veg. I am listing this according to different area but don?t worry you can browse entire city in two hours by rikshaw or two wheeler. Fatehgunj: Kalyan Restaurant Sayajiganj: Satkar (very good food) Dairy Den for icecream Kalyan across University for Fast Food Surya: particulary ?Chhole bhathura? around 4 pm during ?high tea?. This dish is particularly amazing and is available as a part of ?high tea? which is time between lunch and dinner, so you have to be there at that time otherwise it is not offered as a part of dinner. Alkapuri: This is the posh area of City. Express Hotel with its restaurant has good food Sans Sizzler (A+++++) Sandwich stalls outside National Plaza in Alkapuri (yummy...) Woodlands for South Indian Food ?Sasujee? and ?Amtran? for Gujarati food Few popular items of Baroda which any one should not miss: -Solapuri Chevda (can be packed and sent any where and stays good for long time) -Khaman (You have to eat this to know how tasty it is?) -Shrikhand (I think now it is available all around India as ?Sugam Shrikhand? but there are many local outlets which sell much better quality) Festivals: People of Baroda love festivals and enjoy it to its fullest, I will shortly describe two unique ones which I miss most among others. 1) Navaratri: This is happening only here with traditional styles of Garba. From night the city becomes busy with young and old playing garba till morning. I heard that lately City Commissioner decided to stop the Garba earlier around 2 am but in my College days I remember that we used to play garba till morning 5 am. You have to be in Baroda to enjoy this festival. IT IS SIMPLY AMAZING?.AND MY WORDS CAN NOT FULLY DESCRIBE IT. 2) Uttarayan (Kite flying day or Makar Sankranti): You will see curfew like situation on the roads but just look up high in the sky and you will see the sky crowded with kites. People enjoy this festival on their terraces and at night they dance on terrace, eat on terrace and also some of them have fire crackers on terrace. This is celebrated every year on 14th and 15th January and best enjoyed in the older Baroda between 4 gates. Nightlife: Practically nil",Baroda
Bhangarh fort is situated on the border of sariska tiger reserve in the deserted town of bhangarh rajasthan.this one is the most haunted fort in India but I recommend to take water bottles on the mountains as you will not get water up their and climate is also hot.and use side area to claim and to coming back use the same way as other way are bit risky. Archaeological survey of India has put some notice there that after 6 pm or sunset no one can enter.all fort is destroyed but only one temple is there which is not destroyed It is nice place to visit.,Bhangarh
"Once again my visit to hyderabad its after a long time sinve I was from a 5 years .whatever the metrocity is developing day by day, but quality of maintainance under the metro work really really bad and the drainage system gives u lot of work u have to put to get urself from that stuff.so there are some interesting places like golconda kota, charminar, salajung museum, lumibini park and usane sagar.but legimately these places are so cool and the cleaness is good around and inside off them so there are many more things to share but in incomete review thank u",Hyderabad
"Hi everyone today I want to share my views on the Hyderabad city. I had been to Hyderabad from the guntur city by train. I usually travel to this place because of my studies. I had pursed my education in Hyderabad. The Hyderabad city is the fully developed city with many good projects for the it technology. In the city many people survive as it provides employment to large crowd in different sector. It's very easy to access every part of the Hyderabad city as it is well connected to bus station and railway station.we can enjoy many local sightseeing places such a s Charminar, different types of restaurants, multiplexes, Golconda. You can get best accomadtion for stay with the quality food and environment.",Hyderabad
"Very worst management of ticketing and organising system in chunambar boating. Roads are good but roadside parking, lack of median and irresponsible bikers will make you angry so quickly (maybe drunken guys) Suggestion: Pondicherry tourism management can implement online based ticketing system with timeslots will eliminate the hassles.",Pondicherry
"This one of the best place to visit or tour. After a getting a holiday package from company, I am going to Mahabaleshwar place. This is such a awesome place I have a seen my life in Maharashtra state. This is one of famous hill station. Good time to visit this place is a during a winter season or rainy season. In this place multiple points to see. More big big hills water falls, tress. There are many Hotels and resort are available for staying. overall this is awesome place. We have enjoyed the hill station in rains.",Mahabaleshwar
"After a long time a 4 day week came to Delhi. 12th to 15th Aug 2006. We 4 friends were planning where can we go and release our stress and many suggests Rajasthan, but it turn out to be Mukteshwar, a small hill station Near Nainitaal. We decided to stay in Camp tents instead of hotels etc. it took us 8 hrs to reach the camp. The first impression which I got after reaching was negative but after getting out Tent and seeing the view from Tent was awesome. It looks so beautiful that I fall in love with that place on the spot itself. From my tent I can view the Valley and the mountain ranges clearly and beyond the mountain ranges stand the awesome Nanda Devi snow picked mountains. Tent was cozy and good clean. The camp had Apple and other fruits whenever you feel you can pluck from the trees and have it. Fresh air. And in the night you can have bon-fire. The vegetable they grow it in the camp itself so you will get clean and fresh. The people were typical pahadi. Down to earth very helpful and polite which we rarely see in city’s life. There’s a place called TRC or TR6 (Don’t remember properly confusion between C and 6) From there you can view the mountain range 180 degree. During our 2 day stay we did some adventure activities also i.e. Trekking, River crossing or say Kai-Kai some say roping, Mountaineering, and night Trekking Even if you are not interested in adventure sports then also fine. The toilets are not attached its 10 meter away from your tent but clean and hygienic. Water are fresh and chilled. Its said that hill rains are best and that what we are lucky to witness while leaving after the rain there’s was rainbow and you can feel the clouds touching you. And the clouds below your feet level. In the camp there was no electricity, no TV, No Airtel signal (Hutch, Idea  & VSNL has strange know !! but true) and believe me we never felt that the above things we require even, till one guest asked there’s no Electricity in my Tent and we realize that since last 2 days we are spending our days without these things. In future if I get a chance then I won’t give a 2nd thought to go back to this again and again. It’s such a nice place away from city chaos, no traffic just relax. ther e we stay in Purple camp. You can reach there, either by train to Kathgodam and take a taxi from there or take ayour own car. Road is accisible and Good road I must say. and you can enjoy the drive from Haldwanai to Mukteshwar 50-60 odd Km 2 hour drive.",Mukteshwar
"Me and my roomates visited aurangabad before 4 months its really an amazing place to be visited. It is full of historical monuments. The most attractive part is the AJANTA AND ELLORA CAVES which are world heritage it is really amazing, the way it is constructed and its beautiful carving just makes you fall in love with it and it is so vast and spread till distances only for ajanta we spended 6 hours but it was really amazing and the ellora caves took more 6 hrs but they were just amazing. Then the next day we visited daulatabad fort it is so huge and vast the cannons on the top of the fort were really great, then after that we went to Ghrushneshwar temple it was soo beautiful, then we went to bibi ka makbara and then to grave of aurangazeb and his son and his guru we asked some people about them it has a great history about both the places. It just amazed us. But due to lack of time and money we need to stop our journey and returned back. The cab driver was very helpful to us and it took us to the places safely. The city was beautiful but the accomodation facility was ok means not upto the mark and even the city was not so clean then too we just loved this city of monuments.One must visit it.",Aurangabad
"When I visited Rishikesh with my friends for rafting, I went to Ram Jhula also. It was very pleasant experience for us. It was a delight to watch the river from Ram Jhula and I looked beautiful at night. It was so high from the river. It was easy to access through Ram Jhula and there were no restrictions there. The local sightseeing was also very nice. There were also lots of foreigners there. The hotels were available at reasonable rates. But I preferred staying in a hostel there. There were no safety concern there. It was a very safe place. I would recommend everyone to visit Ram Jhula and I will give it 4/5 stars.",Ram Jhula
"Mahabaleshwar is the one of the famous hill station in Western Maharashtra. The atmosphere in this area is very clean and quite interesting. We can reach their by Bus from Pune, Satara, Mumbai.

Many up-to-date facilities are available at Mahabaleshwar. GO carting is available at many hotels and restaurants. Tourists can Enjoy fresh Strawberry in Farms. . The atmosphere makes happy and gives good experience. Local people are helping in nature. Normal safety precaution should be take while sightseeing.",Mahabaleshwar
"Rameshwaram is a place I much of the time gotten notification from my dad and its stories of religious and fascinating significance, however I got an opportunity to visit this place last year.Its about legendary significance as well as its an intriguing spot as well. We cleared out from Kanyakumari in night by Varanasi-Rameshwaram Express and achieved early morning. Prepare excursion wasn't extremely wonderful as conceivably rain had entered the rail compartment and there was water everywhere. Likewise mosquitoes and cockroaches included the hardships. I saw another thing in prepare that there were leased cushion and bedsheet sellers who when the voyage finished asked back their stuff. For the most part there were explorers who began singing bhajans when the prepare achieved Rameshwaram. We fortunately ran over a youthful specialist couple and we imparted the van to them to Gujrat Bhawan which was close to the sanctuary luckily.I thought it must be alright as they showed photos of Murari Bapu however the rooms and latrine were regrettable, I have no clue its such a humming place loaded with vacationers, and still, after all that why there was such lack of care towards cleanliness. As no other place was accessible and it was inside strolling separation with sanctuary, we thought lets hold on for it. We had some tea and snacks and changed into our waterwears of Water kingdom as you need to bathe in ocean and after that in 22 wells of sanctuary before the fundamental supplications. Rameshwaram's ocean is one of a kind in a way that it doesn't have waves, it's a fairly still ocean. We washed in ocean and I discovered that some material like things were sticking to my feet, I soon discovered that there is a custom that individuals leave their garments there. We had an incredible time there and continued towards the sanctuary. It's an old sanctuary with high roof and huge columns, its in grayish shading from outside and stone shading from inside. Every one of the premises of the sanctuary were wet with water as individuals were going to one well to another in wet garments. We too began the custom and a man began pouring one basin of water from each well. At first three wells had frosty water, however soon it was warm and even significantly hotter water from different wells. Each well had a particular name like nal, nil, ganga tirth and so forth. At the point when all wells were finished, we continued towards changing room and changed in dry clothes.We then continued towards the principle focal piece of sanctuary where a tremendous Nandi statue was set close passageway with tongue outside. There are parcel of lines to see the principle shivling however we went all the more near it to play out a puja. It's said that its that shivling which Sitaji made after coming back to Ayodhya from Lanka. I had this misinterpretation that it was that shivling that Lord Ram made when the ocean declined to backpedal. Subsequent to eating at Gujrat Bhawan, we took a van to visit different places in Rameshwaram which are of religious and touristic significance. In the first place we went to see a Vibhishan sanctuary which was desolated in tempest and just old columns were obvious, another sanctuary was raised there some time back. It began raining vigorously there, we additionally observed the coastline of Srilanka from that point, the place is called Dhanushkodi and its ocean all over yonder. At that point we continued towards a three storeyed sanctuary where Lord Ram either refreshed or thought, additionally close-by there was a Hanuman sanctuary where he gave the clip to Lord Ram which he brought from Lanka from Sitaji as a proof that he went to her. Additionally we went to an irregular place called Ramteertham where a well in the middle of the ocean has new water and not salty water, the story goes like this that when Sitaji was parched, Lord Ram made a burrow there with the bow and crisp water turned out.",Rameshwaram
"Best place to visit which is located near Pune. Mahabaleshwar is a hill station which has a very cold climate. Don't use cab to visit this place because they may fool you by charging more better bring your car or your friends car to visit places in Mahabaleshwar. Site seeing places are monkey point, arthur point and  venna lake etc. If it's summer time then visiting this place is preferable just to beat the heat. I visited this place with my dad when I was studying in school which was memorable. Don't this twice, just visit this place , you can enjoy and will have a great fun time with family or friends. You get fresh strawberry fruits and raddish here. Thanks.",Mahabaleshwar
"I had gone to Mahabaleshwar an year back. It was a wonderful experience as I went with my school Friends for a camp. It takes around 6-7 hours to reach there by road. Once you reach there you experience a very cool climate which makes this place a better one. The best time to visit is winters. The availability of hotels is just a lot and it is very easier to find ine with your pocket size. The markets are full of specialties of Mahabaleshwar such as chocolates, accesories and the most famous STRAWBERRIES! The most famous, delicious and mouth watering strawberries can be found here. As Mahabaleshwar is situated on a hill one can visit various points situated there. Guides are easily available which give you each and every information about the place. The visit worthy place is the mapro factory which can be seen from a very long distance because of it's chocolate fountain. For historical places one can easily approach Pratapgarh fort which has it's own history. There is no issue related to safety. This place is easy accessible, easily affordable and a place with a nice atmosphere which makes anybody change their mood",Mahabaleshwar
"I have been in Mahabaleshwar with my wife for one day. The road towards this beautiful Hill Station is also beautiful. You will see Strawberry sellers on both the sides of the road. You will see these sellers once you reach Panchgani. We could cover only two points in Mahabaleshwar as it was just one day trip. The first point was Lingmala waterfall. As it was not a rainy season so the waterfall was not that much attractive with very less quantity of water. On the other side there is one small pond which was very nice with crystal clear water. We could easily see small fishes inside it. The second place we visited is Elephant Head point. We need to walk for 1 KM from the parking. After reaching the destination, you will see this beautiful point and it looks like elephant head hence the name. There are total of almost 12 points in and around the mahabaleshwar but it is not possible to cover all in one day. In a nutshell, you can visit this cool place anytime with your family and friends.",Mahabaleshwar

This is an amazing place to visit it with your friends. This was our first road trip. One of the most amazing journey . I am going to share the joy that we experienced. We stayed in mahabaleshwar for 2 days. We booked a self droven car from zoomcar. We started our trip on 27 December. It took us 5 hour to reach mahabaleshwar. The trip was good but the car made it awesome. We stayed in a hotel which had a great view. In the morning we went to see all the points. I would suggest you to go in early morning to visit those points. The view from the top is amazing and don't forget to try the Maggie that they sell near the points. In afternoon we travelled to the famous temple. Then we went for the boating and horse riding you'll enjoy the horse riding specially. After tjat we saw the waterfall and then we moved to our next destination panchgani about which I will be writing in next review. You should surely go for a roadtrip with your family or freinds to mahabaleshwar.,Mahabaleshwar
"This is the place where we can remove our total negative energy. We can't understand how we changed our life. This is the place where people have kept nature as like natural place. As people can't do anything here. We went here with college tour.We all are students went to the sunset by walking. All hill stations, roads & horse riding ground is super. We stayed there in' Hotel Girivihar Darshan' So nice hotel at that time . After Diwali vacation we went there/They have given us delicious Karanjai . breakfast, lunch, dinner everything is good. Travelling is very cost, Taxi's & auto rickshaw's are too much cost. To stay at Mahabaleshwar for the common people is very hard, Must have to be open small hotels, lodge for them so that they can enjoy their travelling.",Mahabaleshwar

In the month of March 2016 all my team members and I made a plan of boys outing as a weekend trip. So looking at the time constraint and distance we chose bhanhgarh and alwar  as our destination. We started on Friday night and reached alwar on Saturday early morning after taking rest we decided to visit bhangarh in the afternoon. as soon as we entered the fort of ancient times which is suppose to be haunted we saw a hanumanji temple at the entrance and there were other temples also. However I did not see nay notice board or warning sign by the govt placed which most of the people claim that govt has put in the warning boards in the fort mentioning that it is haunted and do not stay after sunset.  We stayed there for 3-4 hours and clicked lot of pictures over all it was a good trip.,Bhangarh
"I was in Pune for 1 month in july 2012. So in between I went to mahabalshwer. When it comes to travel , the travel experience by road was very amazing as the road goes staright from the cities to the mountains of mahabaleshwer and the weather there is so pleasant as compare to Mumbai and Pune. I enjoyed the trvelling experience as well as roaming around when I got out of the car in Mahabalshwer. The temples, local sight seeing are amazing. You can be on the top and can see the valleys downside. Overall experince was very nice. We also went to fort of Shivaji Maharaj from mahabaleshwer as well. I think Mahabaleshwer is really good place to chill out or to get relax on the weekends with family or friends after days of hactic working life.",Mahabaleshwar
"Mahabaleshwar is a very popular hill station situated near Wai, Maharashtra. The place is famous for its various points and Strawberry. The place is very nature loving and you can visit it all year long. You access this place by road only, there is no airport or train station here. Only way to access is by bus or car or bike. Bringing your own car is best as you have to travel a lot from one point to other and having your own transport will definitely help. Even you don't have a car, there are various guides available who have there own transport and you can hire them. Mahabaleshwar has a lot of spots you can see and each spot is a different experience. The place is where you can be with nature through out. One of my best memories are in the place. The most amazing thing is that if you get far enough from all the lights, you can see a sky full of stars. I love going to Mahabaleshwar just for that. Living in the city it is very hard to see stars but here you are HIT with a jackpot and seeing them is breath taking amazing. The various points like offer a great view of the other surrounding mountains. The place is great in Rainy season as you can also see many waterfalls along the way. Not to forget the greenery it brings. Mahabaleshwar is also known for Mapro Garden. Mapro is a brand which offers various products and you can visit and shop at this location. The place has a lot of monkeys and you can feed them and even click picture( just not with them). You can see from baby monkey to the oldest monkey here and they are really fun to look at:-D Hotels and accommodations are decent and are affordable. The food here is tasty and you can get various street snacks at almost all points.  you can make this a weekend trip or decide to stay for a week. It is a really amazing place.

"World is going way ahead with Science and tech, paper note economy is now moving towards digital economy, We have great civil tech which can be used to improve the infrastructures especially in tourist places, and he is our nice old Hill station - Mahabaleshwar, which is still following old stupid trends. Here are following reasons for not visiting Mahabaleshwar -> 1) Worst narrow roads, no parking lots. 2) If you visit this place on a long weekend, you will get HUGE 20 KM long car traffic jam due to tourist tax collection people at Venna lake entry point.(Cant they implement Paytm boards/online ticketing instead of cash collection). 3) Huge traffic to and fro near Mapro garden, worst traffic management. 4) No traffic police can manage the traffic well, they only stand and tell people ""There is Jam ahead, roads are alosed"" 5) You gonna end up waiting in your car for almost 80% of your day time, seeing huge lines of vehicles and ONLY frustration.",Mahabaleshwar
"I visited mahabaleshwar a month ago I got bored there. It's a big hilly area  , nice to see all that but that's not entertaining thing. My texi driver took me for two local sightseeng 1st panchgani and 2nd pratapgadh fort  , panchgani is fine place but please don't go to pratapgadh fort it's waste of time,  there are only marathi people's and they not speaking hindi they only speak marathi and you can only see monkey there or nothing. It's not looking like fort its very bad experience there.  But I satisfied staying in hotel name is silver inn , in that hotel there is no a/c but all other facilities are provided and they have good staff and food is good.  Thinking about safety?  Then it's a safe place but boring place.",Mahabaleshwar
"This was the Mid of June 2012 when we planned to go to mukteshwar and Binsar from Delhi to mukteshwar first and then mukteshwar to binsar by our own car. We started 5:45 am in the morning and reached at Mukteshwar at 4:30 pm after taking no. of snacks and photo session via Gajrola, Haldwani, Bhimtaal and bhowali etc.. We filled our car tank full at haldwani as came to know there is no petrol pump near mukteshwar area. We stayed at early booked KMVN guest house (I think this is only the recommended place to stay as there is no such more options are available) where quality of food was good and location of hotel was perfect and this was only the thrilling concern for us else Place was cool and calm but not so exiting may be because of June temperature which was 35~36 degree Max. and minimum was 22~23 degree. Local Market is 6 Km away from KMVN, Local sight scenes were ok which included chauli ki jali and old Shiv Mandir etc. Next morning we checked out from same hotel at 11:45 am and moved towards Binsar. After doing 3~4 hrs. Driving reached to Binsar gate where they charged 250Rs./ Car and 150 rs. / Person and finally entered in to Binsar area for KMVN hotel again and which was 10 Km away from that gate. Road condition was not so good in last 2~3 km but we were exited as started imagine to reach in deep forest area and we were not so wrong when we saw the location of hotel which was situated at beauti fully location at almost extreme end of hill. Temperature was as same as mukteshwar. Same evening we visited to Zero point and enjoyed sun set which was actually the extreme end of Hill and just 2 KM away from KMVN guest house and could’t find any wild animal or bird in wild life sentuary which was actually the passing way from KMVN to Zero point and we were told that need to be awaked early morning to watch the animals but dropped the idea as we wanted to awaked at our own time. Quality of break fast and dineer was better than average and they do not serve non veg due to norms of wild life sentuary and in morning they do serve bed tea at 6:00~6:30 am and two bucket of hot water to bath before 7:30~8:00 am. Electricity remains between 6:30 ~ 9:00 pm and there after candle is only the light provision. No room service, no TV so better to keep indooor/ out door games. No local market, petrol pump and restaurent in 15~20 km range. Next morning we started for jageshwar temple at 9:15 am which was 65 km from KMVN guest house and it was worth to go over their as temples were litrlally unique and approx. 1300 years old there after we back to our hotel at binsar at 5:30 in evng. Next morning we started back for delhi. As per my opinion better to visit after rain or in winter to enjoy weather, overall it was nice trip and it’s worth to go once.",Mukteshwar
I had visited mahabaleshwar about 2 months ago. I stayed there for 2 days. When I visited there both the days were cold. I was shivering for all the time there due to cold. However this is the best place to visit in a summer. It is the hill station with having great gift of nature's greenery. It is an awesome place to visit. It has 26 points which are famous and quite beautiful. Especially Arthur seat point which is my favourite among all of them. At this point when you throw a coin it comes upward due to the wind blowing from diffrent sides. I am attaching photo of mahabaleshwar so that you can experience the beaty of it.,Mahabaleshwar
"Hey All, Mukteshwar is situated on a ridge between two himalayan ranges and I have been to this amazing place twice... in two months... and the experience has been nothing short of amazing.  Different each time and better than before. The roads by far are pretty good, if you leave Delhi by about 4-5 in the morning coz if you get stuck in one of the traffic jams, the trip would be spoilt. The reason for the jams is the numerous towns dotting the highway.  There is another route to Mukteshwar, which is rarely travelled on, and provides you with a break from the pot holed roads of Rudrapur & Bilaspur.  Take the turn towards Jim Corbett National park from the Moradabad Bypass and head towards Kashipur, from where you would find a right turn, headed towards Nainital, via kaladhungi.  Amazing roads, and more importantly, no traffic to spoil the fun.  The road leads you to Nainital, from where you can head out to Bhawali and then on to Mukteshwar. The first time, we encountered rain and were drenched to our bones when we parked our bikes there and the second time, dry as a firewood log and each time, the views have left me breathless.  Hailing from a hustling, bustling metro, the peace and quite this place has to offer comes as a much needed gift from God in these times of 24 Hour on the go mode. The local sight seeing seems to gake your breath away.  The Chauli Ki Jaali is an amazing place to see & feel the creativity of Mother Nature and then the TRH & the PWD Dak Bunglow Gardens have an amazing view to offer of the snow capped peaks of Nanda Devi, Trishul & Annapurna and the Panchachuli mountains. For the nature buffs, there is a 4 Km walk from Sargakhet, where most of the hotels are located to the Mukteshwar town proper.  inbetween, you would get a glimpse of a huge swathe of Oak Groves,planted and maintained by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, which is the biggest establishment here and makes this town famous.  Also, on offer are mind blowing views of the snow capped peaks and the gorgeous valleys And then comes the hotel... We stayed in a 6 room property, in Sargakhet, going by the name Red Roofs, which I must say comes in at a pretty good rating on my scale... 1-10, I would rate the hotel, services& the staff at 9.5. If you are looking for a rocking time and a place to party, please do not even think of going to this place. The townfolk are the quite sort and would not like the intrusion and disturbaces created by loud music and partying.  But if you want to relax, enjoy the nature and its views and generally want to unwind... this is the place to be.  Although the weather can be a  tad unpredictable at times, it is worth the effort of spending 8 hours on the road to this slice of paradise.",Mukteshwar

I visit mukteshwar when I am going nanital with my frd in june this year me and my frd hire bike and plan to go muskteshwar the beaustiful place fresh air and the wheather was awasome but the negative point of mukteshwar is the road there is no sign board no lights no safty guard and the road was very dangerous so I recommend you to hire a car because the uttrakhand car drivers was experienced and they know about road and most the wheather.and finally I said I remenber this place for whole life and I wish to go there again,Mukteshwar
"I traveled to Mahabaleshwar on 17th of August in 2017 after completing some important work I had in Pune. Traveled there in our own vehicle and I was amazed by the beauty of the amazing hill station. During that time, the weather was extremely cold and wet. Slow rain was falling continuosly and the local people told us that this weather continues to persist here till march. After march the weather opens up a bit and continues to get wet in June. The awesome weather was really enjoyable and we visited some tourist spots like Lodwick Point and the old Lord Shiva Temple. The shopping market is also good and a huge variety of things are available. It is not a worthy market though, because the prices were extremely bullish even in off season. I do not recommend shopping there. Visitor points at every peak of the mountains had an extremely beautiful view. The weather was spine chilling and I really enjoyed my two day trip there. It is really a great place to visit during summers!",Mahabaleshwar
"Jawaharlal Nehru, described Hyderabad as the'meeting place between the north and south'. It was once a prominent trade centre dealing in pearls, diamonds and horses. The Qutb Shahi and Azif Shahi rulers left their imprints on this city of composite culture.

A few months ago in time of winter I go to jaisalmer to visit desert of Rajasthan when we travelling we hear many stories about kuldhara so we decided to go there. Date were 12 February and time was 9.30 of morning. Their I feel a mysterious energy and feel fear .We seen only remains of city. Kuldhara is originally settled by paliwal brahmans. This place is very haunted and no-one dare to come after 7 pm at night. Local Peoples said that many ghost are come at night and talk to each others if someone disturb them they kill that person or thing. This place is so haunted . Safety in this place is very good there was enough police to secure visitors. Hotels are good in jaisalmer you can enjiy pure rajasthani food and enjoy the rajasthani culture .If you want to feel such kind if extreme feeling you should  visit here.,Kuldhara
"Hello Friends, My name is Anil and it's been one year since I come from Mukteshwar but the memories are still alive and enforced to visit there again and again. That was July month and hills are totally lush green due rainy season. Mukteshwar is a combo with Nainital as it just 50km drive from Nainital. There were a very old and famous lord Shiva’s temple situated right in heart of Mukteshwar( one of the Name of Lord Shiva). Hotels are very few over there so you need to plan your day accordingly and come back to Nainital once done. People from hills are very much friendly and always be talkative to support tourism. Since that was a rainy season so adventure sports are being shut but their couple of sports are being organised by local organisers i.e paragliding. I would recommend that at least we should go there once in a lifetime not only for adventure sports but to be with mother nature.",Mukteshwar
I will rate 2/5. Unmanaged place.Highly Expensive. Not all Locals are respecting the tourists over there spcially road side guide and better to skip mahableshwar and visit some other places.,Mahabaleshwar

"On 19th May, 2004 evening around 9 p.m. we left home for Delhi Railway station to board the Ranikhet Express. It was a very hot evening and moreover the Railway Station was over crowded and the consequent heat was intense. There was no relief even after settling on our respective berths. We wanted to get out of Delhi as soon as possible but as if to test our patience, the train started half an hour behind schedule time. The heat continued to haunt us till the unearthly hours. However, by the time the train reached Kathgodam it was so nice that we forgot our unpleasant experience in the train. My feeling of deep affinity with the hills finally actualised into this trip. As we came out of the Rly. Station with our rucksack, we saw a number of taxis and jeeps lined up to woo the visitors. On enquiry we found the cost was not within our budget. So we had to look for the bus stop. We waited at the bus stop for some time and boarded a bus to Bhowali from where we were told we could get some conveyance to Mukteshwar. As the bus moved ahead, the height of the mountain kept on increasing, sometimes coming down a bit and again going up while vegetation on the hills presented new panorama to the delightment of the eyes and spirit. We enjoyed every moment of this drive. At Bhowali we found plenty of fruits being sold at a very cheap price(in comparison with Delhi of course!). We bought some Khurmani and found them to be sweet. To commute to Mukteswar we were advised to take a jeep/car as the next bus would be available only around 2.30 p.m. and it was only 9.30 a.m. So we decided to hire a jeep for Mukteswar. We had to bargain for a reasonable rate prevailing in the hills as rates with the plains differ considerably. The journey to Mukteswar was like flying through the fruit orchards and inhaling the sweetness of the fragrant flowers like birds. Every corner, every turn had something to present to us. The orchards at Ramgarh and the hills at a far off distance continued to show us the divine beauty of nature. Due to smoke and fog, the most thrilling site of the snow bound Himalayan ranges were out of our sight, this was the only sore point. We reached our Guest House at 11.45 a.m. This guest house is run by Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam(KMVN) situated at a vantage point. Mukteshwar at a height of 2286 meter is one of the excellent locations of Kumaon Region that displays the Himalayan range with magnificent views. As we had our prior booking made through their office in Delhi, we were allotted a beautiful room overlooking the whole range. The cool breeze that blew there took away all our fatigue we were subject to during the train journey from Delhi. As if we were transported into a heavenly abode. With a cup of tea, we refreshed ourselves and placed order for lunch. In the meantime we went out to have a close look at the nature and the hills around. Next to our guest house was the PWD Guest House which had a well laid out garden with flowers blooming all around. The breeze was so refreshing that by passing of every moment we felt the touch of nature’s blessings in spite that we human beings are always trying deforesting to cater to our so called needs. I pondered over this ruthless cutting of trees for economic gains. A parallel could be drawn from the story of Kalidas before he became the Great Sanskrit Poet of India. One day he was sitting on a branch of a tree and cutting the same. It is the same situation with human beings now. The plants and trees are maintaining the ecological balance, a life line for all living beings and we are deliberately destroying them! However, we did not fail to enjoy watching a variety of birds flying here and there, the bright sun and it was a perfect day to enjoy. After enjoying the sun for sometime, we came back to our guest house. We all had a quick bath and went down for lunch to the dinning hall. On completion of lunch we had an afternoon siesta and again went out for site seeing. Mukteshwar could hardly satisfy our hunger for seeing the Himalayan peaks as the visibility was very poor due to mist and smoke(we were told that the local people burn the fallen leaves for farming and that causes smoke). Mukteshwar had a unique feature overlooking deep ravine on one side and the beautiful town of Almora on the other. We also visited a desolate temple nearby and we could hear distinctly the rustlings of leaves as if the tall trees were whispering to us the secrets of nature. The night was very cool and the breeze turned stormy as the night progressed. After dinner I strolled for half an hour with a guest who came from Mumbai but I also found one poisonous scorpion trying to get into the guest house. It was just thrown out by one of the guest house staff. Next day morning after a cup of tea and biscuits we trekked down the hill to Sitla. Sitla had abundance of fruit trees like Khurmani, Plum, Naspati etc. we also saw the famous red flower of the hill by name Rhododendron. We were told that during March-April this flower floods the hill side and it looks like the mountains are on fire. we could feel the silence of the nature which was often broken by the chirruping of the birds. After our breakfast we had to repack our rucksack for the next journey to Jageshwar at a height of 1870 Meter. We thought of trek to Sitla bus stand to short cut our journey but it added to our woes and suffering. We three started after saying good bye to the staff of the guest house and enjoyed our trek for an hour. But as the sun slowly heated up the road going got tough. However we managed to reach the bus stand but we missed the bus by a whisker. We had to wait for a lift at least up to Almora. Finally we got a Maruti Van and the fare charged was a reasonable one and we reached Almora around 2 p.m. We thanked our good friend for dropping us at a convenient point.",Mukteshwar

There is internatioanl airport so the travel by air is very easy. By train route hyderabad transport is very easy. Hyderabad connected to all major stations of india.  By road hyderabad is also good because the roads are very good and all the vehicles availble for travel in hyderabad There are too many local sights that are good for visit. Most famous monument in hyderabad are charminar and golkonda fort that show the beautiful and rich history of hyderabad. If you visit hyderabad dont forget to taste world famous hyderabadi biryani. Some places like birla mandir, zeological park, lake,  parks are visiting places in hyderabad. But main bad thing about hyderabad is old city is very conjucted and polluted.the traffic is worst in old city. You feel very bad smell when you pass on. Charminar is situated in old city that why it is very irritating to visit. In hyderabad hotels and accomodation is very good. According to your budget you can choose your hotel or lodge. Hotel radison is very beautiful hotel to stay but it is expensive. Hyderabad is historical city thatswhy police force is always there for safety. But you have to take attension from theives in old city. Because there are much crowd and roads are very small so people take advantage of it.",Hyderabad

Hello everyone today I want to share you the experience of my tour which I had in last week to Hyderabad. I had a great experience this is a small city situated in Telangana Andhra Pradesh. There are many fabulous things to do in Hyderabad. One of the best thing which I experienced was the Snow World in Hyderabad the entry fee of Snow world is 500 rupees but it is worth as it is giving us an awesome experience. The next famous all time favourite thing of Hyderabad is the Hyderabadi biryani. The one and only one the famous Paradise hotel for biryani. Hyderabad is also known as city of pearls. And also is important for its great historical significance. One of the best historical significance of Hyderabad is the Charminar. Charminar is situated in the middle of the city in the busy market. The next important historical significance is Golconda Fort it was the best historical place which I have seen as the architecture building and construction of the Fort is mind blowing even the decorations and architectures of that time are still there. So this was a great experience for me to be in Hyderabad and I would suggest you you can have a trip to Hyderabad and enjoy thank you.,Hyderabad

"As you all know that Bhangarh is a government approved haunted place in India known for paranormal activities there. My trip to Bhangarh is my most thriller experience trip in Bhangarh. The place attracted me because of its popularity and old story related to ghosts. I was not able to see or feel any paranormal activity there, may be the reason is that I was in Bhangarh in the day. Besides the story and horror, that is a nice place to visit, gives you a good experience with ancient arts and the fort is quite good to see. Night stay is not allowed due to security reason. I interact with the nearby peoples who told me the story of bhangarh and about the cases happened there. If you are searching places to visit in Rajasthan then you can add Bhangarh to your wish list.",Bhangarh

"For years, I  was told about Bhangarh is known for its stories. In March, 2016 I had planned for a tour to Bhangarh wuth my friends. It was good experience knowing the stories and meeting people there. Somehow, it looks like dangerous place and the might have some solid evidence, therefore the government of India has declared it as one ofvthe most haunted places of India. The entry in the fort after 5 in the evening is strictly prohibited. That is very excellent place and has many hidden stories behind it. I would prefer you to go and expore on your own so that you can decide according to your experience whether the place is indeed haunted or not. Do wear leather shoes or some good quality shoes before going there because that is very hilly area, and try to keep that beautiful place clean.",Bhangarh
"This city was famous earlier because of enormous charms and beautiful tourist spots.But now it's not at all the same.The reality is as below., 1) Mosquito city.you will find lot of mosquitoes all over Hyderabad and people are getting sick because of Dengue and Malaria like symptoms all over city. 2) Very Un-Hygienic city in terms of cleanliness.it's one of the dirtiest city in India.you can't even think of going in public toilet. 3) No transport facilities especially to  High-Tech City area where most of the IT companies are located. 4) Lot of dirt, pollution and accidental roads everywhere.no proper drainage systems so water keeps on accumulating producing multiple diseases in city .no healthy measures.",Hyderabad
"Bhangarh Fort is a historical memorial built by Raja Madho Singh in 1631. The fort is located in the primordial town of Bhangarh, which lies 40 km from Jaipur and is about 300 km from Delhi. According to  stories, no one is allowed to enter the fort premises once the sun goes down. several incidents where nomads or volunteers opted for a night stay in the fort, but never made a return from the fort the next morning. Therefore, strict restrictions have been imposed; you have to leave the fort premises before dusk. The main entrance to the fort is locked and remains out of harm’s way till the next morning. local sightseeing is awesome as fort. near local village shop for shopping. hotel/accommodation is not available bhangarh, only in alwar delhi highways. safety is most import which not safe after sunset. please  to leave the fort premises before dusk.",Bhangarh
"The Ruins of Bhangarh fort are small and highly overrated about the supernatural stuff. It takes about 3 hours to visit the place from alwar. Due to its remote location and poor road connectivity, it is recommended that one reaches the fort by 1200-1300 hours and leaves by 1630 hours. Do carry snacks and drinking water. There is no need to hire a guide inside the fort as its not such a massive place and trust me going bhangarh in day time is such a waste of time because you wont feel any such thing in day time",Bhangarh
"I visit bhangarh and I think that must be 100% haunted. But I does not feel any paranormal activity there. I talk to nearby people , but they said old stories. Any single person is currently not present there who say that I saw or hear something there. I also did not see or hear anything there. Some area of the fort are dirty and it smells very bad. The management of the fort is not so good. It needs improvement. The haunted tales of bhangarh is really good but they are very old. Now I think there is no ghost there.",Bhangarh
"Being a Hyderabadi, I visited a number of places including Gol Conda fort, Hitech city, several nizam palaces, Hussain sugar, Imax, Charminar, Medak church, Salar Jung Museum and many others. I always give preference to watch a big Hollywood movie in Prasad's multiplex in the Imax format because of its screen picture quality presence and sound intensity. This screen is treated as a second biggest screen in Asia. And also loves to visit NTR gardens to goof around. Gol Conda fort is one of the main assets for Hyderabad. It simply reflects the grandeur image that Hyderabad had in its medieval period in terms of art, architecture and engineering skills. There is a myth about that fort which relates to Hindu mythology and happened during a medieval Hyderabad Nizam period, that Lord Ram along with Laxman visited the fort in order to free his devotee Ramadasu. The fort is one of the biggest of its kind and expanded to several kilometers, and there is also another myth , old people say that if we dig near Golconda fort we will be lucky enough to find diamonds ( I don't think its a good idea, it might be a general myth ) telling us that, during that period Hyderabad was filled with abundant gold and diamonds. Near to Golconda, there is another monument called taramari baradari. there is another palace called queen bhagmathi palace and it is said that the Hyderabad was a gift to that queen and there was also a telling that she was the most beautiful women in south India during that period and her beautifulness was always compared with the brightness of the full moon, by the pandit poets. The palace is situated on top of a hill and the architecture involved was in a  Persian style. Later I would like to tell about the iconic Charminar which is the landmark of the Hyderabad. The city is also called as pearl city. The Charminar was constructed around 1700 to give tribute to the people who were affected and fought with deadly plague disease. The Charminar is located in old city of Hyderabad. There is a mosque called Makkah Masjid. It was constructed with full of unique architectural style. There is another mosque which was constructed with Spanish engineering skills called Spanish mosque. Hussain Sagar is also the main attraction to Hyderabad. The Buddha statue located amid of water is a treat to watch. The parks around it give a lively feel. Salar Jung Museum is one of the finest museums in India. It is also the biggest one. It has several collections of artifacts about Hyderabad Nizam kings. Nehru zoological park is also biggest of its kind. It has a variety of collection of rare animals. The plantations, gardens, and animals inside this park leave an irreplaceable mark about mother nature in our mind. There are several palaces of different nizams covered around the city. Yadgiri gutta, which is a sacred place for Hindus, and it is a Devastanam of Lord Narasimha. The temple is situated on a hilltop. Near to this temple, there is a fort called Bhongir fort which was treated as a border for Nizam dynasty in the medieval era. It is located on top of the stone hill. By seeing that fort, everyone will get a doubt that how on earth that fort got built on that kind of hill. It is tallest and seems to be bigger in size. We can find many cannon ball shooters there and guns that were used by the army of Nizam. Hitech city is the hub for software industry which ranks second in terms of software delivery to the world and places next to Bangalore city. Medak church is the tallest church in Asia. The designs and paintings on the walls of that church will let you be in spellbound. The church is simply mesmerizing beauty and art. During Christmas, it will become the busiest place on earth. I am proud to be Hyderabadi and always be. Badminton, Bussiness, Bahubali, Biryani are special in Hyderabad.",Hyderabad
"As I am fond of new things and If it has sime believe then I am fond of it. To know Bhangarh is one of them and I have planned to visist the place.

"Bhangarh Fort, one of the most haunted places in India. Locate at the Aravali Hills in the deserted area. Bhangarh the city which remains are left over is between Jaipur and Alwar.  There are many stories related to the ruined city. Aprox. 278 km drive from Delhi, Bhangarh fort which is guarded by the Police and archaeological survey of India is a place to visit once in a life time. Bhangarh Fort which was once six storey palace now, remains just two storeys. Bhangarh Fort surrounded by wall all four side. The fort included demolished houses, market places and the only thing that remained intact was the temples inside the premises of the Palace. There is lot to see and explore in Bhangarh as said by the Locals there. I would say one day trip is enough for the most haunted place in Asia. However, the trip was worth for me. Please visit during day time only.",Bhangarh
"Hello friends, we already know that Bhangarh is famous as hunted place. Last time I have visited there. It was not good place. There accessibility not good as I have expected. There I did not get any vehicle. I have go my personal car. I have visit there with my friend. Hotels are in high range. And there everything in higher range. It is expensive too much. There is no safety in bhangarh. There local sightseeing is also not good. I would recommended this place to anyone.",Bhangarh
"It was an unusual trip. A trip that could make or break a legend. A legend which has been painstakingly built over a period of around 250-300 years. No, I am not talking about any high profile persona. I am talking about an-once-upon-a-time-flourishing kingdom which now languishes in ruins. Yet, hair-raising accounts spread through word of mouth and staunchly believed by the locals still make the rounds to the extent that the Archaeological Survey of India(ASI) has been compelled to put up a board at the very entrance forbidding tourists from visiting the place before sunrise or after sunset. A wall has been erected by the ASI to demarcate the forbidden area. The officials are still at work but leave the premise as soon as the sun tilts towards the West. However, before stepping outside the premise they make it a point to pay their obeisance at the Hanuman Temple right next to the entry gate - a gesture of thanksgiving that the day is over without any untoward event. The guards holler a ""Koi hai kya?""  before calling it a day just to ensure that no tourist or trespasser has absentmindedly wandered off inside never to safely return ever again. The locals make it a point that their herds and cattle do not stray inside at ""unearthly"" hours. Such is the aura of the haunted city of Bhangarh, now in shambles, yet still holding traces of an ancient planned city with flourishing trade and commerce. The ASI is trying to rebuild the old glory little by little in the shadow of what they have gathered from their excavations. As one enters the premise, the cobbled pathway leads to a colonnade of shops - the remains of an erstwhile busy market place. Stand tall amidst the rows of shops are the  two-three storied houses of the rich businessman or the Nagar Seth and the royal dancer or the Raj Nartaki. The path winds towards the imposing entrance of the Fort which is right at the back flanked by temples on either side - the Gopinatha temple right after the entrance  and the Shiva(Someshwara) temple to the left of the Fort, at the back. A well-manicured grassy lawn sprawls like a green carpet upto the steep incline of the Qilla or the Fort. I asked Mr. Sharma, our knowledgeable guide, whether the entrance to the Fort was deliberately made unnavigable to make accessibility difficult for invaders. To which he replied in affirmative, ""Also, the fact remains that the passages were used to be constructed keeping in mind visitors/travelers on horseback"", He added. The day was cloudy and grey. It had been drizzling throughout. Taking to the dangerously slippery incline was a test of one's will and physical prowess. Everywhere was  picture of dilapidation. Broken steps, cracked walls, dust ridden, windowless rooms and corridors which smelled foul of bat feces. In the courtyard lay mounds of stone, a testimonial of the arduous exercise being undertaken by the ASI, to reconstruct history. We were told not to press on the walls hard as they may cave in by the mere touch of our hands. Yet, we spent a while in the Queen's Boudoir(Rani Mahal), the targeted destination of this strange and bewildering journey. It's said that this was the place where the Zee News Team, conducting a research on the hauntings, had detected the vortex of ""negative energy"". Securing permission from the Government, the Team  which even included a Lady Doctor, had visited the spot in the dead of the night(between 09.00 and 10.00 PM). What exactly had transpired thereafter was not known. But one of the team members was found seriously injured while the Lady Doctor had slipped into a state of unconsciousness. The unremarkable site has many intriguing and interesting tales surrounding it: Legend No. 1:  The city magician named Sewda, had an eye for Ratnavali, the queen of Bhangarh. Once when one of her maids was returning to the palace, after purchasing a few things from the market for the Queen, Sewda accosted her. Involving her in small talks, he managed to cast a spell on one of the items to be used by the Queen. The Queen, who was also quite conversant with such evil spells and black magic, could make out Sewda's misdeed beforehand and recast the spell in such a manner that it boomeranged on Sewda. As a result, Sewda died and it was the dying magician's curse that led to the destruction of Bhangarh. Legend No. 2: Once the city of Bhangarh was hit by a swarm of locusts which destroyed all the harvest. The king called upon the magician Sewda to get the city rid of the destructive pests. Sewda agreed to use his charm to save the city. However, it was his express wish that the roads should be deserted at a given time when he would be casting his spell. Accordingly, the city-dwellers were told not to venture out of their houses after dark as were the villagers advised to bring in their cattle and herds home before the pre-decided time. However, as fate would have it, a cow and a bullock, who were ownerless, were left unattended on the otherwise empty roads. When the spell was cast by Sewda the locusts swarmed out of the city and settled on the beasts. Consequently, they died a painful death leaving a curse on the city which led to its untimely devastation. Legend No. 3: Man Singh, the king of Amber, had  gifted the city of Bhangarh(established in the early 1600's) to his Jagirdar Madho Singh. However, as the city of Bhangarh gradually prospered and became a power to reckon with, Man Singh became insecure and jealous. He waged a war against the king and destroyed the city. The residents of Bhangarh fled to Jaipur(founded in 1727). With the passage of time, the city of Jaipur thrived. However, it's said that the Pink City was remodeled on the lines of the vanquished city of Bhangarh. According to our Guide, Mr. Sharma, this is a more authentic reason behind the fall of  Bhangarh. But the folklores have it otherwise. As with the fall and desertion of Bhangarh, stories of hidden treasures followed, fortune-hunters flocked in to try their luck. The wise Mr. Sharma vouchsafed that ill-luck had befallen many of them known to him. However, he attributed their haplessness to many more practical reasons than curses and spells. Nevertheless, the city of Bhangarh has risen to fame on account of its cursed fall. The hauntings, like many other dark mysteries of the past, will remain unauthenticated till we ourselves get rid of our tendency to believe in The Unknown and The Incredible. Likewise, Mr. Sharma's narratives oscillate between the pragmatic and the incredulous. Once upon a time a father and son passing through Bhangarh after nightfall came upon this huge celebration of  revelers. Pandals were erect with decorations and red carpets were rolled out  to welcome guests. The tired travelers  were courteously invited to partake of dinner. There were two separate rows for vegetarians and non-vegetarians, respectively. By mistake, they sat in the wrong row when one of the elders gesticulated at the right row for them. After having a sumptuous meal they felt sleepy and dozed off. In the morning, they were found in the barren fields by the thorny bushes. Gone were the procession of men and the arrangements of lights and feast. Mr. Sharma certified that he had heard of this extraordinary experience straight from the horse's mouth! Bhangarh, situated near the Tiger Sanctuary Sariska, is around 100 Kms. from the peaceful city of Alwar. From Sariska, it is around 50 Kms. Bhangarh falls within Rajgarh Municipality and is near Dausa. However, Dausa lacks in good tourist accommodation. Therefore, best is to stay in Alwar, which has many private as well as RTDC Hotels and Resorts. Those who wish to club a Wild Life Safari with spooky adventure, can put up in Sariska. The road to Bhangarh, through sleepy villages, is real bad, bumpy and uncared for. The lesser known  Ajabgarh precedes Bhangarh. After the fall of Bhangarh, Ajabgarh too was deserted. It is dotted with newly built houses and ruins of ancient ancestral properties which have not been reclaimed by successors. One has to traverse the periphery of Sariska Forest to reach Bhangarh. By the time its dusk, returning from Bhangarh, one may be lucky enough to cite wild boars and Sambhars, languidly crossing the road, as we did. Bhangarh is a heritage site. It is the most visited over the weekends and Mondays. It is also a place of annual congregation of Tantriks who throng in hundreds during the Navratras in the lunar month of Ashwin  - the Kaalbeliyas, the Saperas and other tribal castes.However, Mr. Sharma confirmed that they were the harmless ones who rather believed in keeping their powers a secret using only for the betterment of fellow beings(?) We were a little crestfallen to find the intrigue of Bhangarh being spoilt by a troupe who had been given the permission to shoot in the premise. Most of the tourists had come looking for the spook yet the atmosphere was marred by noise and rowdiness of undisciplined crowds. Although, it is strictly prohibited, we also saw families squatting and having kind of picnic at the spot. Visitors like me with the sole intention of having a ""feel"" of the Paranormal, were quite lost amidst thousands of crunching, trampling footfalls. Yet, slipping unaware on the wet inclines of the Qilla and almost getting a cramped leg, missing a step on the stairs where my shoes got stuck without any visible reason, and twice the camera hitting the stone walls which could have cost me a fortune, no more than a fortune, as it stored the innumerable clicks of the Fort and the Queen's controversial sacro-sanctum, I wondered whether there was some unwarranted force which was warning me not to transgress my limits. It's just a thought or may be a mere superstition. Yet, who knows? Happy Haunting!",Bhangarh
"Hello everyone, as we already know that Bhangarh is best known as haunted place in Alwar. Recently I have visited there. It was not good as I have expected. There is nothing good.

"Hi Folk.! Like too review some deep details about Bhangarh me and my friend visited the one of the most haunted place in India as per ASI. We were studing about this place from past 1 year finally on 14/1/2019 we have visited Bhangarh fort. When you visit the fort in entry you will find the fort is surrounded by the strange large hills on all the sides its naturally very beautiful, more than 500 visitors very day visit here. From the very starting point you need to walk till inside the fort for around 1km, in winter you will find strange coldness inside the fort compare too outside. The entry of the fort is very insane all broken rooms and very different structure with all cracks in it and when slowly you enter inside its totally made in the upward and you need to walk more, its more like an olden era and feel something very strange with the old temple. When you will move inside the fort there are rooms made for the servants of the queen then some dark rooms and with strange feeling of coldness, the local people say they heard people talking inside the in nights and the time you entered there you will feel the same. I will give 5 out of 5 for this thrilling amazing place and must visit whenever you be in Jaipur or near by. I share some of pictures taken inside the fort.",Bhangarh
"BHANGARH is a famous haunted place in Alwar, Rajasthan. Last year on the trip to Alwar with my family I visited this place and truly it is not at all interesting. There are no special medium of transport to BHANGARH . Took your own cars or hire some taxi or bus. We reached there at afternoon. I never had gone through a haunted place so this was even more exciting. You may think to have a guide with you but its better not to have, rather use Internet to know about it more. Basic information about the palace are written in front of the palace. After the main door, there are ruins of market which once might have flourished. There are banyan trees which makes it even more weird. Then comes a board declaring the palace to be a haunted one. Now that Palace had only three floors but once it was having seven floors. But ultimately there was nothing interesting about BHANGARH . It was simply a time waste. You will didn't get a feel of any mystic powers. It is just a ruined palace having stories of love and thrill. If you have dare to spent a night there only then you should go otherwise there are lot many better places in Rajasthan.",Bhangarh

I went to this place with my best friend and parents on 26th of January this year. At first I was very excited about visiting the place after reading about it on google. My parents did not want to come so they stayed at my relatives house. When I visited the fort I was getting a very weird feeling. It was not a delight to the eyes was just like any other normal fort. However my condition sudenly deteriorated and I vomited after coming out. So my advice is do not make it a planned trip and I would not suggest anyone to go to Bhangarh.,Bhangarh

"We visited this famous and holy island two months back and had a memorable stay there. This place really very beautiful and has many mesmerizing factors which will attract any traveller. I was totally mesmerized by the beauty and calmness of this island. Even though this island is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, the ocean currents are very less and the waves are very mild. Daily hundreds of pilgrims dip in this ocean water as if they are dipping in a river because of its low tide and waves. The view of the wide stretch Pamban bridge will surely amaze everyone. The Ramanatha Swamy temple is a very holy and famous temple as it is one of Jotir Lingas of Lord Shiva. Many pilgrims from all over India visit this temple and bathe themselves at the holy teerthas. These Theerthas are very unique to this temple. Apart from this there are many other temples such as the Ramar Padam, Seeta padam, etc. We may even go to Dhanuskodi to visit this lost town and the remainings including a temple, an old church, etc. More than all this what attracted me the most was the house cum museum of our ex president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. His old  house has been replaced by a new building built by him and one of its floor is converted into a museum. We shall get to see the Padma Awards and Bharat Ratna won by him. This museum also has the different medals and prizes won by him from different universities across the world and also gifted by dignitaries of different countries. This will surely amaze any visitor and makes us understand how intellectually sound he was. He has got a huge collection of books which even includes Bhagvat Geeta and the 4 Vedas as well. His diary with his writings and findings, his personal belongings, his dress and all are the other attractions. This museum is treasure zone containing the memories of our Missile Man and his hard work. In Rameshwaram there is also a memorial built on the place where his mortal remains are laid to rest. We should never miss to see this if we happen to visit Rameshwaram.",Rameshwaram
"I visited this place to explore the famous bhangarh fort which is one of the most haunted place in the world as people say. Let me tell you that reaching itself here is a big task , the roads are so bad and narrow that even two bicycles cannot go on together. There are no good and hygenic places where you can have food . Now, finally when we reached bhangarh around 4 in the evening , I thought now some adventure will happen but trust me leave aside something haunted even nothing is there to be seen also. I climbed even to the top where people say that paranormal activites happen and so called Tantrik ki chattri but this was the biggest mistake I did because even there was nothing to be seen . So , I highly recommend not to visit these place as nothing adventorous is there .",Bhangarh

"Rameshwaram was always in my wishlist as there are many sight seeing places nearyby. Being an Hindu this place would be in everybody's wishlist. It is full of wonders and were all the myths are followed for so many years. People usually do poojas for all their ancestors at this holy place. It is believed that if we immerse ourselves in that holy sea all our diseases will run off and all our bad sins would go off. You will feel a change within yourself. There is a sivan temple which has 21 wells and each well has a holy water.  I went there recently as I am from chennai it is around 560 kms from here. We travelled here from car and felt very tired, it is better to travel via train. There are both good and bad hotels for accomodation which are very near by the holy sea with reasonable prices, few hotels charge you for 12hrs and others for 24hrs. It is also a safety place because there will be so much crowd but it is our duty to take care of our belongings safely.",Rameshwaram
"I have visited this temple  4 years ago. I can tell this island is full of wonders , myths and faiths. It greatly reveals the epics of our hindu culture. It is the place where lord sreerama installed the lord shiva linga. So it is popularly known as rameshwaram. There are many small theerthams near to this place such as ramatheertham, lakshmanatheertham, hanumatheertham etc. Afew kilometres away we can find dhanushkoti where vanara sainyam built varadi to lanka. The sea in rameshwaram doesn't have any waves or tides which amazes the people.one more important thing is the wells. There are 22 wells water which is called as sacred water. Atleast once in a lifetime everyone should visit this holy place.",Rameshwaram
"Dear friends,  I visited this place in 2013. In this connection I would like share my experience about Rameshwaram. Rameshwaram is one of the important Religions center for Hindus. Because here only KASI YATHRA ends.  Here, Rama made Pooja to Lord shiva in ramayan period. after lord Shiva given his blessings to rama. So that this place called as RAMESHWARAM.  It is situated near Madurai. AGNI THEERTHAM  is one of the ocean in rameshwaram. In that ocean you must bath. After that in temple there are 22 well. In all 22 Well water is coming in all the sundays. After that we can reach near the Shiva statue.  PAMBAN RAILWAY BRIDGE is one of the oldest railway bridge in India. it was built in the British period. This Railway Bridge is surrounded by Ocean. When you are going by Train you can enjoy! Plenty of Hotels & accomodation in rameshwaram, from the starting prize of Rs. 500/- only. So a coomon man also stay there. In my observation ssftey is good, but in night time near the sea-shore area is danger.",Rameshwaram
"It is one of 12 shiva Jyotirling. Being lord Shiva devotee, I have visited this temple with family. You have to take bath in sea. After that you have to take bath in 21 well. water taste of each well is totally different. Some water were hot and some cold. After taking bath, change the cloth and then go to queue for Darshan. Temple architecture is made in dravidian style and its corridor is longest in India. In evening, you can visit some local temple also. I have seen floating stone also which were used in Adams bridge. Going and coming back in train via Pamban bridge was wonderful journey.",Rameshwaram
"The spiritual destiny was in my wishlist for years.It was a boring afternoon when I suddenly asked my dad ""Shall we go to Rameshwaram? "".  It was a usual reaction from my dad to the adhoc plans. Unstoppable,  on the spur of the moment,  I looped in my grandma along with my parents. Looked for train tickets from Chennai, Indian railways is yet to be equipped for adhoc tour planners like me:).  We decided to travel by car and set on out journey the same evening by 3. I Stay 150kms down south to Chennai. The two best possible routes are Trichy - Madurai - Rameshwaram or Trichy - Pudhukottai- Karaikudi-Rameshwaram. We chose the Madurai route. Reached Madurai by around 7-30. It was dinner time.I chose to try the small and petty food ships on the roadside. scrutinizing the right place to eat, we travelled on the Madurai -Rameshwaram road for more than half an hour.When my dad lost hope that I could find a better place,  I pointed a small thatched shop where a middle aged couple was making hot Idlis. Enjoyable dinner in a breezy night. Reached Rameshwaram by 11-30 PM.We preferred a place near the temple and travelled towards the temple. The road led to the end of the town. Fortunately,  tamilnadu tourism hotels was located at the very end and just near the temple.A very decent hotel for a medium budget.And more importantly,  this is the best place to have a beach view. My mom came with the load of instructions from my uncles. 1) Visit agnitheertham first - nothing but a dip in the beach situated near Ramanathaswamy temple. 2) Go to temple - Visit all the 21 theerthams. There are 22 wells from where water is drawn and you could drench in the divine waters. It is believed that when Rama and Sita came from Srilanka,  they made Pooja for Lord sivas sand sculpture and had a bath in all the theerthams. There will be agents in the streets who will be taking you to all the theerthams and in return you could pay them money. Else you could just reach out to all the Wells along with the crowd. 3) Once u visit all 22 wells,  it is mandatory to take bath.My suggestion is to go back to your hotel.and refresh and visit the Lord. 4) Once we refreshed, we came to temple for getting Darshan. Temple was not crowded. In half an hour we were back to the hotel. Next comes the interesting part of the journey, Dhanushkodi. I was so curious to visit the place. Hav heard stories about the tsunami and how the whole town was destroyed. It is located 14 kms from Rameshwaram. There are buses from Rameshwaram. We landed up in a place where there was a broken bridge and a few small shops.  From there,  private vehicles are not allowed.we hav to book a jeep or van. We travelled by a van.  An adventurous journey  ,  they will travel along the shore and sometimes in the waters like a hovercraft.  By the time you reach  Dhanushkodi,  you will feel."" Hushhhhhhhhhhhh.I reached. "" When you land you will be in a small island in between two oceans, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean.The island has the ruined church, watermark, railway tracks. once where people enjoyed a living there and the Ocean turned against them mercilessly. Definitely it could have been the beautiful place.  Srilanka is just 18 kms from this place.  And when I had a chat with the van driver, he said the place will be fearful in the nights.  The sounds from the ocean will be terrifying and how the sound from one side is different from the other side of the ocean. There are still few families living in the place even though the Govt declared it an unfit place for living. Okay,  now it's time to return. And back toward Rameshwaram and return journey. So long I din open about another exciting thing, Pamban bridge. To reach Rameshwaram we hav to cross this bridge.  Scenic blue ocean with boats dotting along the shores. The speciality about this bridge is the railway track which is made of a steel structure across the ocean which opens up for large ships. It was dusk when sun made a silver lining in the sky. Rameshwaram is majestic. Beaches, temples, Pamban bridge. Ofcourse a place of historic importance. Mention not. Localites were so polite and helpful. It was an unforgettable experience when our car key was not working and it stopped in vibeeshna temple which is located when we travel from Dhanushkodi to Rameshwaram. The autowalas gave a temporary fix and we hav to make duplicate key in Ramnad. We took Karaikudi-trichy route for return journey. Must visit places: Ramanathaswamy temple Dhanushkodi A pause at Pamban bridge APJ Abdul Kalam's memorial which I missed Vibeeshna temple Few places are best suited for photography. Best travel mode: Railways from Chennai or bus from Madurai. Food will be average.  I did not find any regional cuisine native to Rameshwaram. Convenient hotel: Ttdc hotels. Located near temple. Clean and they provide complimentary breakfast too. There are some exotic beaches which I didn't visit. Try to find out and spot one.",Rameshwaram
"I have visited this amazing place with my family in vacations. I think this is the best piece of nature in India, blue ocean, blue cloudy sky. Temple in Rameswaram of Lord Shiva is located here and it is very old and the shivlinga was made by pandavas in ancient time, temple of rameswaram is the best example of architecture, big pillars, wall designs and paintings. Culture of south India is very good. You can eat south Indian food there. Nearby temple there is so many hotels for staying there. Local sight seeing is also very good like Pamban bridge, Dhanuskodi and many other temples. VISIT HERE ONCE WATCHING NATURE PIECE",Rameshwaram
"Hello friends, This is Kumar, I would like to share my bitter experience with a fake Pandit in Rameswaram. We contacted Aswini kumar sarma in Rameswaram for Abdikam, Tilahomam & Nagaprathishta. He charged 35000/ and asked us to come Sri Raghavendra swamy mattam beside nodder Lodge. We paid 35000 but at the end of the programme we found him as a fake Pandit. He is using same Naga stone idol, clothes, 9coconuts and dhanyam. Dhanyam should be used for the naga idol to sleep whole night. That should not be used again. When we went to a hanuman temple to Prathishta Naga idol which was made of stone we shocked to see as he didn't arrange cement work to paste. He just asked me to keep that idol on the floor to complete the Naga Prathishta. We questioned him how could he call this Naga Prathishta without nava danyalu and without pasting with cement. He told that workers unavailable. The truth is after we return back he will take that and reuse for others. If he was a real brahmin, he would not do this type of sinful deeds. The main other thing is just dial also fake when I tried to submit the review that was not posting but next day we found someone kept good review with my name.",Rameshwaram
Hai guys I  here to share about Rameshwaram one of the most holy places in india.Mostly all the people in India will cost to this place once in their life.Mostly the Hindu people cost this place once a year if they have they will cost there often. All of them know about the historical epic of Ramayana.The Lord krishna's one of the avatharam is Rama avatharam.He created the statue of Lord Shiva to worship that place became a big temple now.He crossed through these ocean to kill ravanan and bring with back. There are lots of temples are there to see.when we reach the temple there are many peoples are there to tell about the whole place.Nice views are there to see.The hotels are good to stay.And the foods are also good.Outside the temple there are more hotels we can choose it which we want and comfortable for us. Lots of handmade things are solded by the people living there  nice to see and buy it. When there is festival that time only we can't get any rooms to stay. Other wise it is a good place and we can take the childrens for the vacations.It is a hot place but we can see more new things in there childrens also know about our worships.More beautiful places they can see.They definitely like this place. On the whole it is good holy place we should see.thank u for seeing my review have a good day.,Rameshwaram
"Rameswaram is located in the Ramanadhapuram district which is in the deep south of Tamilnadu. There are so many tourist attractions in and around rameswaram example pamban bridge, dhanushkodi etc,   this place is very famous for its own mythological story called ramayanam as everyone knows. Rameswaram  also known as the  holy land for Hindus, yes I agree but now the holy land is fully polluted with human waste and over crowd. people are coming from all over India but I don't think they are treating this place as holy because they are simply coming and throwing all their used things into the sea and scribbling some rubbish on the walls of the  beautiful temple. The main specialty of this temple is 1000 pillars which is done with a sing rock but people are never cared about the importance and the architect of this beautiful place.  the place is not at all looks like a holy one. please hereafter take some responsibility and try to product our ancient resources. TRANSPORTATION: Government and private buses, trains and flights are available. flights means the nearest airport is in Madurai. you can take your own vehicle also.",Rameshwaram
"Best place I had visit anymore place than this I loved it and I feel like a man in the pamaban bridge. Accessibility like many see related items are been placed over there and good to by those all because fully traditional oriented and many small temples and olden homes are we may see then many hotels are available to stay. Local seeing like best place is that dhanushkodi which was now well developed by those government they put roads to reach that place its awesome to Ride in that road because it was fully covered by sea only this way to travel both the left and right are full of see alone till our end of our eyes watching best no words to share that moment. Hotels are like many we may stay in brindhavan hotel which was good service nice to stay there we had received such complimentry if two water bottles and bath towel, like those needs alone and break fast like some cookies with coffee good to stay there and nice to see the beach. It's fully safety and they were taken such safety measures and if any problems are arise cops may be there in a minutes and our property our own things show be take such more care and all safe manner.",Rameshwaram
Hellonfriends today I will review my experience about my trip to the holy place Rameshwaram. I had went to this place two times. So leats see the whole review.Accessibility: - It was a island and connected through a newly built road bridge and an old railway bridge which was in the list of most dangereous bridges of India. We hsve to take a train from Chennai Egmore and it takes upto a whole night to reach and some other trains from Madurai Tiruchirapali which was very closed station to rameshwaram it take 5 to 6 hours from these stations to reach Rameshwaram.Sightseeing: - It was a holy and traditional city so you would be able to see most of the temples and as it was an island so you can also see the seasheels shops and jewlery shops in the city. Had a very nice view of the ocean. At the end of the island you can see the two different oceans meeting. One is quite and have less water but other have giants waves.Hotels: - Due to it was a tourist place many peoples come here so you can find many hotels and guest houses here. The hotels are overall ok but you hardly find differennt food from Idli and Dosa because there are less hotel serving this and some of them are not at good.Safety: - There is much safety than other cities from thiefs but there is no gurantee of the weather change it changes suddenly and the island has a record of storms and heavy rainfall by which the water pevel rises and the rail lines are blocked because the rail bridge was very old and not a good hight. this was the only drawback of this city.,Rameshwaram
Bhangarh Fort is around 80 Km from the Jaipur Railway station and to go there we have to rent our personal vehichle because no vehicle facility is available for going there.The place is famous for negative things but I do not felt any negative feeling or anything suspicious there.Bhangarh Fort is very dirty and you will find unhygienic and non-social things all over the fort.There is no shop near fort and no security gaurd for inspection and gaurding.Number of tourist visitors is also less.It is situated at the middle of Bhangarh Village and there is only one resort nearby which is not safe and good to stay for family.So you can go at your own vehichle with no safety of life and utilities there as the place is not very lively full of people.,Bhangarh
"Go round the world and have a great time, but then the actual satisfaction is attained only afer you reach home. Baroda- the cultural capital of Gujarat , now known as vadodara-the city of banayan trees, is a place where u feel at home. Not very crowdy and full of tranquility, it is a best place where person can be at ease with nature. the people here are so helpful and kind that no matter from whichever place you come, you will feel at home. worthseeing places includes a museum and a lot of historical monuments.

With a couple of multiplexes and malls you can find a lot of places to hang out. visit baroda atleast once and enjoy life to the fullest with mother nature. but be ware of the time when you visit baroda. during may and june it is very hot during the day time. however, even during summers you can enjoy baroda in the evening time.",Baroda
"Enjoyable as a half day or one day picnic Need to carry some fruits, eatables along if reaching around lunch time but not planned for temple Prasad. Very comfortable to play in the river water including children Sufficient visitors at least on holidays. Neither crowd, nor lonely. Individual boating not available Camel and horse ride available on water front Plan to get out to highways before dark as the area is not much populated. We planned to get ourselves some half day picnic we decided to go to Nareshwar(26 January, Holiday), a place along the river Narmada. Nareshwar is approximately 60 km from Varodara(where I stay) and went by our own vehicle.  The place has a lovely temple. All the temple campus is extremely pleasant to calm down your mind. On the back side of temple(half km of walking) we reach Narmada river. The river span is very huge and the structures on the banks indicate that water level do reach dangerous level for picnic activities. However at least on that day, the river water level was such that we could play in 2-3 feet of water even when we get 25-30 feet from the shore. The water current was light and we soaked ourselves in Narmada for almost an hour. There are camels and horses available for children to enjoy a ride. At 3:30 pm, we decided to have darshan at the temple and leave at such a time that we reach on NH before it gets dark. Temple timings: Closed from 12:00 to 2:30 pm during the day Having food: Facilities at nareshwar are not adequate to have proper meal. If you reach before 1:00 pm it is possible to receive Prasad at the temple. We reached Nareshwar at about 1:30 pm and had some hot served bhajias(gotas, as it is popularly known) at a local restaurant along with some fruits(we carried along) and soft drinks. On the bank of the river there are plenty of makeshift tents installed by the larriwallas selling sugarcane juice, tea, coffee, bhajias, boiled sweet corn etc. as snacks. This provides enough option as a light meal on a picnic. Driving directions: Searching for driving directions on internet it was indicating a route of approx 19 km from Palej, a town on NH8. Our neighbours informed that there is a road straight to Nareshwar not far away after leaving vadodara on NH. Acoordingly we found that road as proper road signs were available. This is approximately 6-8 kms before Karjan, a village on NH. Nareshwar is approximately 23 kms from here. However, the road was not in good condition and we had to drive slowly. On our return journey we took a turn towards Karjan at an inter-connection. Joined the NH at Karjan and headed back to Vadodara. This route adds a few kms but the road was far better.",Baroda

"Hello guys today I am going to share a review on rameshwaram. Recently I have visited tamil nadu for a summer vaccation. And I am very much dissapointed to know that their is no such place to visit which makes us to feel like a tourist place. I have visited various spot at rameshwaram and not happy with the environment because it is very dirty and unhygienic. Also, their is a huge problem in conversation with the peoples as language is a barrier. So, I can say that rameshwaram is not a attractive tourist place.",Rameshwaram

"Vadodara!  A clean city I would say . I was in vadodara for 2 months interning in ONGC . vadodara is huge and beautiful city . Firstly, I would like you speak about locale . They were very hospitable to me and never said no for my help at any time . Tourist attractions are many to name a few sayaji baugh, LVP palace - a magnificent place to visit( but high cost for entry pass), Sursagar lake in heart of city catches every eye of a tourist, many beautiful temples in and around baroda. Mouth watering street food, dairy products are plenty . public transport in my place is only by Auto . They were very much harsh in taking longer routes to new people and minting money from them . There were 2-3 bizarre encounters in regards with this particular issue . This is only thing I was disappointed . Night life is so unique and simple over here . It was a fresh experience . I visited in summer, The climate was too harsh to bear often temparature shoot up to high 40's There are many hostels, PG accomodations available at reasonable prices .  Vadodara is one of safest place to live . my experience show that cost of living is a bit high there . Fruits and vegetable price are quite high compared to my place There are plenty shopping malls, movie complexes, street shoppe areas to hang out & finally the place is full of little kids I enjoyed playing with them in nights . I was several times requested by landlady to visit baroda during Dussehra! Hoping to visit Hard time for Non veg lovers . There  are very much limited places  to content over chicken hunger .

"I traveled to Lakshadweep in the third week of Feb 09 along with my wife. I had booked the Coral Reef tour from the SPORTS (A Lakshadweep Tourism undertaking) which is a 3 nights /4 days tour covering the islands of Kavaratti & Minicoy.The journey is through Tipu Sultan. Which docks at islands during the day & sails at the next island in the evening. It offers two types of accommodation i.e. First class cabins (2/4 persons per cabin with attached bathrooms) & tourist class –reclining chairs. The first class has 36 seats and the charges are Rs 11, 000 per person & the tourist class has 120 seats and the charges are Rs 7, 500.00.Food & all sports activities except scuba diving are included in the above charges. We had booked first class cabins We boarded the ship at around 10.00 clock & the ship was scheduled for departure at 12.00 co*k. At around 12.30 our Tour assistant Mr.Firoz called us on the deck as the ship was about to depart. However the vessel developed a technical snag & could depart only on 4.30.Well gradually the ship sailed away from Cochin port & within about an hour all that we could see is only blue sea on four sides & sky above. The ship was moving at a steady pace & few of our tour members even experienced motion sickness. I was told by Firoz that the ship was very old almost 25 years hence the speed was less. We reached Kavaratti Island the next day at around 11.30.We were transferred to a small ship that took us tourists to Kavaratti while the vessel sailed to Agatti Island. As soon as we neared Kavaratti island the color of the water changed from green to light blue & then to turquoise blue. The water was crystal clear & we could clearly see the bottom. The white sands & the swaying coconut trees left us awestruck. We truly had too pinch ourselves that we have such lovely sun kissed beaches in India which till date we have seen only in foreign locales in Bollywood movies. We had a quick lunch & then we went on Coral sight seeing through a glass bottom boat. Everybody screamed in joy at the sight of colorful fishes & corals. Post this we took to Kayaking. Believe me it’s a very simple sport & the life jackets ensured that even non swimmers can enjoy the sport. After this Mr. Bashir, our Sports Contact in Kavaratti took us for snorkelling.We was thrilled to see the colourful fishes, corals & fauna. They live their own sweet tiny little world. We saw fishes of all colours, shapes & sizes zooming past us. Then we took turns in Speed boat & were allowed to drive the same. It was great fun. We returned to our vessel by around 7.30 pm & enjoyed a sumptuous dinner. We reached Minicoy on the third day where we were looking forward to Scuba dive. On reaching Minicoy we first visited the lighthouse which gives a breath taking view of the entire island. After filling a simple form we were taken to the scuba spot where we were taught a few breathing techniques & sign languages to communicate in water. Scuba diving was one of the best experiences I have ever had wherein I not only touched the corals but also could see the fish so closely. The rest of time in Minicoy was spent in Kayaking, folk dance & village visit. We reached Cochin port on the 4 day with very special memories. I would like to make a special mention of another couple; Sagar & Keerti whom we met on board and thoroughly enjoyed their company. Also all the staff whether on board & on the island was very co-operative & helpful. Overall the Lakshadweep tour was a very good experience something unique & different from the run-of the mill hill stations & sightseeing.Lakshadweep is a must for all adventure sports enthusiasts The best part is except for scuba diving which is charged @ 500 per person all the sports are included in the package. Even the food is good & served on time. In true sense of the word Lakshadweep is Paradise on Earth.In case you are planning for Lakshadweep & need any information pls M2M me; I will be happy to help you Thanks Bijal Gandhi",Lakshadweep

"Wanted to take my family of eight members to Lakshadweep in this December. Websites showed all tickets are full for December. I happened to visit visitlakshadweep.com/index.php as it pops up when I mention ""Samudram package"". This is where I first came in touch with its owner Abdul Salam. He assured me that he can give me seats from ""emergency quota"" of which he told me 15 were available. The condition was that I pay him the full amount immediately.  He did not give the credit card option, but was ok with NEFT. I immediately transferred Rs1, 20, 000 on Sept 25, 2018.  He confirmed the receipt through SMS, after I insisted for it.  However, he did not issue me any receipt. I thought he will do it subsequently.  But did not, even after 3-4 days.  Then I received an email from Lakshadweep holidays asking me to send them the payment details for creating ""exchange order"".  I replied to it saying I have done it already. Then onwards, I did not get any replies to my email asking for the receipt nor Abdul Salam was picking up my phone.  Once he finally picked up the phone, he told me he is in Lakshadweep and will send it on the following day.  Nothing happened, even after one week. It was the 14th day after I made payment, and at the back of my mind, I was thinking, is Abdul Salam a fraud?  I made a quick google check putting in his name and his company name.  Shocked to see several posts claiming that he has cheated several people.  I telephoned the government owned site on Lakshadweep tour packages and mentioned about Abdul Salam.  I got a reply that ""he is a number one fraud"".  ""Do not make any payment for the reservations with him"". I whatsapped him about this concern and told him what I read about him in the internet, and asked him to refund my money.  He seems to be regularly checking the messages, but intelligent enough to disable the blue tick, thus we never see any blue ticks.   I came to know this, after I received his reply.  In his reply, he brushed aside the internet comments, saying that it is his competitors trick. I told him in clear words by email, to either pay my money within 24 hours or face a police complaint.  That really worked and he promised to refund me the entire amount within 24 hours.  Since then, he has transferred the entire amount within 24 hours. In conclusion, I personally was not cheated, though he gave me times of anxious moments. He spoiled my December holiday though, by giving false promise.  Extremely dubious and risky to deal with.  Be careful!",Lakshadweep

"My wife heard about Lakshadweep Tour Samudram package and was excited with good reviews from her colleague. She explored and got the number of travel agent Abdul Salam(visitlakshadweep.com/ Mobile - 94951 13798). We got quotation on various packages and we finally decided to go with Samudram package. The agent offered 10% off when we make full 100% payment in June itself(2018). Tour is scheduled in Dec 2018. The agent was very courteous and patient in explaining us in very detail about the tour. He was considerate about our dietary restrictions, asked about the special food requirement for our kid and many others. We called him 10-12 times for all clarification, and every time he is very soft spoken and picked up the call on 1st ring. We felt that we were very lucky to get a good and professional travel agent. We made a transfer of full 100% amount to their Syndicate Bank account with Account Name Lakshadweep Travels. It was on 22nd June 2018. He promised to give LTA certificate post the trip.  We booked our flight tickets from Hyd to/fro Kochi. We get an email on 26th June saying that because of monsoon whether the tour dates are changed. Instead of 26th Dec the cruise will start on 22nd Dec. Thankfully we booked refundable flights. We had to pay nominal amount for changing the flight dates. Post June, we never called him until the tour dates were getting closer. We called him in Nov to check if there was any impact of floods on the tour dates. He texted saying he was driving or in cruise or will call us back. After multiple attempts of calling he said everything is as per schedule. Just one week before the tour date we called him multiple times if anything is needed from our end. Upon insistence he asked for aadhar card numbers.  One day before our tour date(21st Dec) we got a call saying that there is a problem with the deck. Its under repair. Upon discussed he suggested to start from Hyd and reach Kochi as he was looking for alternatives. We believed him as earlier there was a change in tour dates because of weather and reached Kochi. Have called him multiple times to check the status and every time he gives some or the other answer(which we mostly ended up believing him). First reason - Problem with the cruise, 2nd Reason - VVIP visitors using the cruise so our tickets were in wait list, 3rd Reason - Figuring out Air India Flight to the Island and we can catch the cruise in Agatti Island. We ended up believing every excuse he gave as that is the kind of relationship he built with us by that time. Called him 20-25 times to check the status, either he responded immediately or responded after some time. He arranged for a local Kochi tour as an alternative.(This way he diverted our attention). Post the tour upon insistence he booked us a hotel. For those two days I checked my gmail, watsapp, text message and call log 200-250 times anticipating an update on the tour. Slowly the rate of response started dropping. Post day 1 of the tour he again tried to make fool of us and was giving some other excuses and was telling that he was still arranging for some flights(Air India flights does not fly to Agatti on Sundays) and he was promising for that). My wife realized that he was cheating, but I still thinking he is genuine and gave her reasons that he might have goofed up our booking. Finally we asked for refund. He transferred Rs.25K immediately. saying that his account has a limit of 25K per day.  we asked him to book return tickets to hyd which he did after a day. Cost was about Rs.16k which he agreed to pay as compensation for tour cancellation. (Total we paid is 80K+). transfer of 25K gave some homes that he is genuine. We came back to Hyd. He stopped picking the calls. We were able to get hold of him through alternate numbers on his website an d by calling from unknown numbers.  He said he does not have funds now. Waiting to get a cheque of Rs.1 Lakh. 1 day passed, 2 days passed, 3 days passed. excuse 1, excuse 2 excuse 3 and so on. The excuses changed every day for not transferring. We dropped him an email saying we will post about him in social media, fill an online complaint with kochi police, complaint in consumer forum but nothing deterred him. I told him to reduce(16K flight booking from remaining amount) if it helps. He said okay. When called him multiple times he said he did not have any money. I forced him to transfer atleast 1 rupee for that day. He transferred 1K rupees. We lost hopes on recovering Rs.40K from him. Lastly I dropped an email saying I will complaint to Kochi police if I dont recieve the money by 10 am morning. To our surprise he transferred it. I think it is all part of his strategy to get 100% booking amount 6 months in advance, once change the tour dates to make us believe that weather will impact the tour, then call us one day before and do this drama etc., We did not lose any money but it was a bitter experience with lot of frustration talking to him and getting worried about whether money will be refunded or not. So be very careful of booking the tickets with genuine agents.",Lakshadweep
"When I spent my seven days holiday in Ajmer, I got a news  about Bhangarh Palace from a hotel stuff. I am a tour operator. I need to promote my tourism business. So, on fifth day I  start my journey towards Alwar, where bhangarh had situated. There was lots of tourist gathered in front of Bhangarh palace gate. When I have entered in this ancient palace . I got some irritated feeling on whole body and my ear heared some whispering. I felt that something wrong is happening. There was a notice board by Archeological Survey. I am doubt about that. Really this place is haunted and also a bad place.",Bhangarh
"My rating is not for the place but for the things you need to arrange & be ready to face.I travelled in mid dec 2015 So to start with you need permit to enter each island.So one cannot enter kavaratti with agatti permit or minicoy with kadmat permit. So be ready to get police clearance from your area.This is a new introduction and time consuming. U may have to pay 300rs for this.Once u get the police clearance certificate u need to get the permit from cochin. The govt dept which issues permit will not answer your calls(as u know it is govt). So u need to spend some money & time for permit. Without permit u cannot board the flight.Once u reach agatti(only airstrip) u will be picked up by ur homestay guy. Agatti is a very calm & beautiful place.U cannot do anything other than relaxing in the beach.So book ur stay for not more than 2 days.U may visit Bangaram on one of the days. If u have not booked the tour from sports council u cannot go for snorkelling, scuba diving as it is all managed by sports council & the stay is bit expensive than the normal home stays.U still have 1 place in agatti for snorkelling but a bit expensive and not so great. So to conclude it is nothing but a failure by the govt in improving/organising tourism. So few things before u plan ur trip. 1.U need permit to visit each island.Getting permit is a hectic task. 2.Other than relaxing & enjoying the nature u got nothing to do there. Stay is quite expensive. U need to pay for each and everything.nothing is free. Lakshadeep tourism is not well organised and hence plan a trip with stay not more than 2 days. Ship package is still recommended than by air.",Lakshadweep
"My first encounter with Lakshadweep would have been when I was in 4-5th standard. We always represented it with few dots at the lower left part on the map of India. For next two and half decades my impression of Lakshadweep remained the same till I made a visit to this spectacular place very recently. It definitely is much more than few dots. I had been to few such places across the globe but the combination of sand, water, nature, and solitude did not even come close to what Lakshadweep offers at less than half the price. Images of turquoise color water with pure white sand are just difficult to get out of my mind. Visibility of water would put the Bisleris and Aquafinas to shame. With snorkeling gear I could see the corals and colorful marine life in full clarity even 2-3 meters deep under water. For someone bit adventurous, scuba diving provides an out of the world experience at least 10 times better than available on Discovery channel. As far as the tourism is concerned it is mostly managed by government (SPORTS). Out of 7-8 major islands, private resorts are available only at Agatti and Bangaram; the latter being twice as expensive as the former and hence mainly to attract foreigners. We (my wife, daughter and I) were supposed to travel to Kadmat but at the last moment our destination was changed to Agatti. It takes about 22 hrs to reach Agatti from Kochi by ship which is fortunately very well managed. This island is probably 4-5 kms long and so thin that you could actually see the waves on either side of you while standing in the middle. Amazingly the behaviour and the color of water is different; one side being calm and turquoise green whereas the other being aqua blue and slightly rough. There are no restaurants, movie theaters, or theme parks for entertainment. Other than enjoying different water sports activities only thing you can do is to soak yourself in water, sun, and sand. There are no discotheques or any kind of night life so people with this kind of taste should rather head to Goa. To sum it up, there could be few hiccups while booking your trip because of our beloved Babus. However, once you reach there I can bet you wouldn’t feel like leaving this place. Unless you possess some divine powers, this is probably the closest to heaven you can get.",Lakshadweep
"Hey guys, I a college student in chennai . As you must be knowing pondicherry is very close to chennai, so I frequently visit that place. Firstly pondicherry is a beach destination, ponidcherry has both kind of beaches the ones where you can get into the water and also the ones where you can just sit and relax. You can rent a bike there for transport, we usually do when we go there. There are many bike renting shops . If you want to just relax I would suggest you to go to the rock beach in the night. The beach is lively even at 2 am, there is cafe on the beach where you can sip a cup of coffee while the cold breeze is taking away all your worries. If you want to get into the water and have some fun you should go to the paradise beach, I suggest you should go there in the morning because they wont allow in the water in late evening. You have to take a ferry to that beach. There is also  mangrove forest near pondicherry the place is know as pichavaram. I you have time you can even try this place.",Pondicherry

"Kuldhara is an abandoned village in the Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan,  India.  Established around 13th Century,  it was once a prosperous village inhabited by Paliwal Brahmins. Now it became a desert.  It is having nothing.  And also most hunting place.  Goast Town is one of the main attraction place here.  After sun set no one be there.  Be careful if anyone want to visit this place.",Kuldhara
"Delightfully beaches, Arabundha ashram, and street which are symbol of Duch dynasty all these are to be seen in Pondicherry(puducherry). You had better go by foot into Pondicherry because all seen are important in Pondicherry. You can see lot of houses, which made in 19th or 20th century still now in Pondicherry. I think that it is the different of Pondicherry when we compare to another city's in India. When I reached in Pondicherry railway station there was ruined. Even beginning was wet. I already booked room in a hotel(Accord Puducherry). so I nearly go to room and taken a rest. after my lunch I went to botanical garden. It is beautiful place with big trees and bush trees. Arabindha ashram, Park and secrad church are near about botanical garden but I trot out some time in botanical garden and suspended other places into tomorrow. How to reach: There is two train in a week to Pondicherry from Kerala(Train No: 16856, 16858) and train run between Chenni .",Pondicherry

"I am visiting Kerala in February this year together with my family but my trip is already soured by the fraudulent  / incompetent business practises of an agent operating in Kerala, The agent in question is Lakhadsweep Holidays who I paid a deposit of 47, 377, 75 INR to for a 5 day package to visit The lovely Lakhadsweep islands. The deposit money was taken out of my account on the 14/9/15 although many times afterwards Lakhadsweep Holidays denied recieving the money. I asked the company several times to contact their bank to see if there was a transaction problem but although they promised me that they would, nothing happened. It was not until the 9/11/15 after I had contacted SPORTS that he admitted that the money was in his bank account which caused me both stress and money as I had to do a money trace(which costs money). Lakhadsweep despite my attempts to ask for a refund communicated that they would go ahead with the holiday transaction for the agreed date of 21/2/16 even though THE PACKAGE DID NOT EXIST(The Samudran package starts first in March). I am now in a situation where they have said they would pay the deposit back on the 25/11 but have not / can not /will not send me the evidence that they have started the transaction and I have of course not recieved my money. I dont know if Lakhadsweep Holidays are crooked, fraudelent or just incompetent but either way It reflects badly on Kerala tourism. I would like anyome who reads this to noy use the Lakhadsweep Holiday and hopefully one day the tourist board(whom I am in contact with) will take the companies license away from them so they can not operate and other tourists will not have the same experience as me. I can provide e-mail corresponence to back up my claim if that is neccersary.",Lakshadweep

"Poducherry is one of the best tourist destination in india to visit. Last month I visited with my friends for 2 days tour from karnataka. Good points The city is very clean and well managed and the hotals are also availabe at moderate price. The beaches like paradise beach, rocky beach and auro beach are the main attraction for tourist. similarly, auro villa is one of the famous destination to visit in puducherry. For the bar lovers there are lots of option available. Bad point The things I didnot like is to pay a sum of 300rs to enter in the paradise beach which should be free to the tourist The other thing I not liked is the bars are easily available but dance bar and party nights are available only at weekends otherwise its the very good tourist destination and honeymoon spot for newly married couples.",Pondicherry
"One of the most beautiful tourist spots in India. We took the Samudram package in Oct. The ship is really grand. The rooms cozy and comfortable with attached  toilets. And the ship overall is so clean.  Dining area is good & Food on the ship is OK. On the islands is good. Nevertheless it’s the beauty of the islands that enchants you. We visited Minicoy Kalpeni & Kavaratti islands. All three are different. Can’t afford to miss out anyone. Blue sea at Minicoy, Beaches of Kalpeni and Snorkeling at Kavaratti. It’s a must. Different shades of blue, millions of corals and billions of multicolored fishes welcome you. Snorkeling Speed boating Scuba diving kayaking or just leisurely banana boat ride. You ask for, its there. The staff on ship and at resorts is Very courteous smiling and ready to help. Do carry a lot of sun screen lotion & large hat. And yes don’t forget to carry a good camera.  You’ll run out of memory but not the sights. Overall a great Grand experience. Definitely coming again",Lakshadweep
Very good tourist place to hang out.had a very good experience there where in you get seafoods for worthy price especially fish and prawns.accomodation also is very nice and is worth staying there for some days in low budget.you can go boarding and get into ship also which is a very nice experience of your lifetime.peiole are also friendly and security is also tight especially in the beach.i want to go again and you also I suggest to do the same.,Pondicherry
"Hello guys! I have been in Pondicherry for more than 2 months before few years ago. I love Pondicherry because of its sights and tourist spots. I would like to share some details about Pondicherry to you. Pondi is in Tamil Nadu and it is one of the union territory. It is considered to be one of the important territory.

So I strongly suggest you all to visit Pondicherry which will be lovely to all.",Pondicherry
"Pondicherry or Puducherry, as it is called is one of the prominent tourist destinations in South India. It is primarily known as a spiritual centre, being the headquarters of the Aurobindo Ashram. Pondicherry is also known for its beaches. And that was the main reason for my weekend visit to Pondy with family. My daughter had not seen the sea and thus we had planned a sea/beach visit. The nearest sea is in Chennai, but considering the fickle weather there, we decided to go to Pondy. Location & Travel Pondicherry is a union territory, which is a former French colony and hence the French influence is prominent in the buildings and especially the roads (eg : Rue Francois, Rue Vinayaka Kovai). Pondy is located some 300km from Bangalore and is easily accessible by road. But we preferred the train route for convenience. The Garib Rath Express is an excellent train, with flawed timings!! It leaves on Friday night and reaches Pondy on Saturday morning, but returns on Saturday night itself and thus allows visitors to stay only for one day. For those who want to reach quickly, you would rather prefer the bus. Stay Since  we were not staying overnight, we preferred to choose a smaller hotel.  There are a large number of good guest houses, but unfortunately all  were booked. We chose Hotel Kanchi after reading an internet review. The less said about the hotel the better. It is not a hotel, rather a cheap dilapidated lodge. The only thing I want to say about this hotel is – avoid like the plague. For those visiting Pondy, you can try to book a beach resort or stay in one of the guest houses, which are clean and very economical (but you need to book in advance). Local Travel For those who want to travel on their own, cycles and motorbikes/kinetic honda are available for rental. For others, there is the autorickshaw. I always thought Bangalore autorickshaws were the biggest bandits, but the Pondy rickshaw drivers take the cake. There is no meter installed in the auto and you have to bargain beforehand. Some of the tourist locations are outside the city and a weird part is the trip to the location costs lesser than the return journey. But once you finish your sight-seeing and want to return, the autodrivers know that you are at their mercy and hence they fleece you. It would be a wiser thing for you to book an auto or taxi for the entire day, rather than haggle with these money-grubbers. Places we saw There are lots of things to do in Pondy, but keeping in mind the time constraint, we could visit only a few places. Here are details thereof :- 1) Paradise Beach : This was the highlight of the visit. You need to travel to the Chunnambar Backwaters boathouse,  which is around 8km away from the city. The facilities there include a  park for children. It also has motor boat rides and jet scooter rides.  But what you should do is take a boat trip (Rs.75/- per head) and they take you to Paradise Beach (15 mins boat ride). Paradise Beach is an island located in the backwaters, surrounded three sides by the backwaters and on one side by the Bay of Bengal. The beach is pristine clean,  thanks to the entry fee and to the limited flow of visitors. You are  asked to stay for an hour and then return, though no one monitors your  timing. Clean white sand, the gentle blue sea,  place to sit and watch the waves – this is heaven!! For those who like  the beach, you can easily spend a couple of hours here and have a gala  time, like we did. Food though is a problem for veggies  and hence we had to leave early. My suggestion to visitors is to spend  half a day here and pack a lunch with you (though the boards say outside  food not allowed) 2) Serenity Beach : is the main beach located 10-15 mins away on the East Coast Road. The entrance to the beach is through a small lane between houses. The beach is crowded, dirty and the water too is soapy.  The waves here are rough though. Overall you can drop in for a few  minutes, but this is not a place which you would enjoy with family. It  is suited for those who like to drink, smoke and ogle at foreigners. 3) Promenade Beach : is located in the city, but this beach has been dammed with rocks to prevent visitors from playing in the water. This was done after the tsunami. Also, the current is very rough  and if you venture close, you can be washed away or can break your head  on the rocks. Throughout the length of the beach, you have vendors  selling a variety of foods. It would be nice to sit on the rocks and watch the sea and experience the spray on your face. But unfortunately, the place stinks of excreta and you would be better off standing or taking a walk. Good place to spend an hour in the evening. 4) Bharathi Park : This has the famous monument erected by Napoleon. It also has a small playground for children (not maintained well). 5) French quarters : The  city is divided into the Tamil and French quarters. The French quarter  is different in the way the buildings and roads are built and it would  be interesting to take a walk here in the evening. 6) Vinayaka Temple : There is a beautiful Ganesha temple to visit, for those who want to satisfy their religious urges. Other places to see 1) The Aurobindo Ashram in the city was where Aurobindo Ghosh and the Mother stayed. A good place to visit for the spiritually inclined. 2) Auroville : is  a community with people from many nations staying. This is located  10kms outside the city and has a beach (infested with hippies). 3) Botanical Gardens : has a musical fountain show in the evening 4) Sacred Heart church : is known for its stained glass art. Places to eat Pondy is a paradise for non-vegetarians, who can get a variety of sea food. Veggies have lots of options in the city, but not many options outside. a) Adyar Anand Bhavan (A2B) offers fantastic finger-licking good south Indian food. b) Bombay Anand Bhavan is another good option for veggies. c) Pizzeria : near Auroville, is famous for its hand-tossed, wood fire pizzas d) Le Café : near the promenade is a good place to have a cuppa coffee in the evening. Overall opinion: Pondicherry is a great place to spend a weekend. Not much to see for more than 2 days. But it is a pleasant place to visit especially in the winter. Summers though are unbearable. If you are spiritually inclined or a sea lover, then drop in to Pondy for a weekend visit and make sure you spend lot of time at the beautiful Paradise Beach.

"India is a state in which it attracted outsiders submitting is constantly ahead. Puducherry Union Territory of Pondicherry, India's capital.  Pondicherry from French, Dutch and Portuguese is the authentic association. Indeed, even much sooner than the race that opportunity is the privilege of the French individuals. Islia their way of life still exists in the otherworldly place. They used to breathe easy on this. The streets are spotless and appears to be precisely how you will draw in. The outline depends on the French matrix example of the city. Which puts useful for see  Here you Paradise, Serenity shoreline and Auroville, Promenade, the War Memorial, Statue Dupliks, Romain Roland Library Church and Our Lady of the Angeles can witness some space.",Pondicherry
"Lakshadweep may be the smallest union territory of India, but for me, it is the best holiday trip in India. I went there with my family last Summer by flight. The place is very peaceful and relaxing. There are many islands in Lakshadweep. It is so beautiful that its beauty cannot be captured by any good quality camera in the world, it has to be seen by your own eyes. There are many good hotels and accommodations for tourists in Lakshadweep too. This place is very safe for all tourists. This place is one the best holiday destination for tourists. I would recommend others to visit this place at least one time in your life.",Lakshadweep
"We wanted to holiday at a destination wherein we could relax, a non crowded place with scenic beauty and zeroed in for Pondicherry. It turned out to be a perfect holiday destination Peaceful Pondicherry. It’s a Union Territory town bounded by the south eastern Tamil Nadu state. Winters are the best time according to me to be here. We took a flight till Chennai and then hired a cab for Pondicherry. Distance between Chennai- Pondicherry is around 140 kms, 3-3.5 hours drive. There are two routes to reach Pondicherry, one is via Eastern Coastal Road and second is the NH32. Recommend ECR route at least once, though the road is single lane but passes along the coast with greenery on most part of the route. On the way you can also visit Mahaballipuram, known for its temples and monuments built by the Pallava dynasty in the 7th and 8th centuries. I strongly advice on booking accommodation in White Town(area), while at Pondy. As Promenade beach, the heart of the place, will be at walking distance. Most of the tourist points/ places to visit in Pondicherry are at a walking distance from White Town. My recommendations on list of places to visit in Pondy are Seaside Promenade, Statue of Gandhi, French War Memorial, Statue of Dupleix, Old Light House, Church of our Lady of Angels. A walk of 15 minutes on the Seaside Promenade and you will cover all these points. A must visit is Bharathi Park, Park Monument(Aayi Mandapam), Sri Aurobindo Ashrama, Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple, Police Museum, all at 10-15 minutes walking distance from White Town. The shaded trees all around and cool breeze makes Bharati Park very beautiful, besides park is maintained.in fact most part of Pondy is well kept and clean. One must meditate at Sri Aurobindo Ashram, amazing energy and blissful. Visit the Ganesh Temple i.e. Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple, for the number of Ganesh idols all over the walls of temples and small temples within the main one, do not miss the prasad around 12 noon and to be blessed by an Elephant in evening. Police Museum, first of its kind for me, is worth the visit. It displays the arms and artillery of French era. Another place worth an experience is the New Light House. Reach the place by 4 pm as 5 pm is the closing time. Be prepared to climb around 14 storeys to reach the top of the light house. The view of Pondicherry city from there will be worth the efforts. We have never been at the top of the light house so we were in complete awe/ wonder. Another blissful and heavenly place, not to be missed at all, while in Pondy is Auroville. You can visit there either by Auto rickshaw or Ola/ Uber as its at around 14 kms drive from white town(around 2 kms less from the city). Ensure you watch the video at the reception area, read about the concept of Auroville. In case you are staying in Pondicherry for few days get the registration done in person to meditate at Matrimandir, 2-3 days in advance. We missed on it. The energy is so high, very peaceful and full of greenery. Please maintain silence to restore the sanctity of the place. Botanical Garden and Paradise beach are also listed in places to visit and from what I had read are beautiful. We did not visit them though. Again these are at a distance from city so hire a cab or auto rickshaw. Any tourist place you wish to visit in here, check their opening/ closing timings online, or reach before 5 pm. Exceptions to these are Promenade beach and the Ganesh temple. Do not miss sunrise and evening walk at Seaside Promenade. One must roam around the streets of Pondicherry on foot(walking), to get the glimpse of French era and heritage properties. Streets are clean and maintained. One can also hire bicycle or two-wheeler. White town and City part is safe and under Police surveillance. Restaurants I recommend for French/ Continental delicacies are Le Chateau Auberge Heritage Hotels Meraki Eatery Teahouse Coromandel Cafe. For Indian food I recommend Adyar Ananda Bhavan. Must have ice cream at Gelateria Montecatini Terme. Hotels recommended by me: Villa Du Ocean Promenade Pondicherry Le Chateau Maison Petite Le Dupleix in White Town. In city I recommend Shenbaga Hotel and Convention Centre. Boutiques to shop: Janaki  Anokhi Kalki  in white town and Auroville. Souvenirs can be bought from Nehru Market  Grand Bazaar. I recommend Offbeat Souvenir on Nehru Street for magnets, mugs and T-shirts on Pondy. Also, try Auroville for souvenirs. Items to buy are magnets, terra cota stuff, Hammocks/ dream catchers(from shops opposite Auroville). I want everyone reading this post to visit this place at least once for its simplicity, peace, Seaside, French heritage and Auroville. I loved Peaceful Pondicherry. I wish to come back.",Pondicherry
"Hi all of my mouthsut friends, I herd about pondicherry from my husband, we visited pondicherry for visiting Sri Aurobindo Asram and its beautiful place, its a peaceful place I have seen ever and of course this is my personal opinion, Accessibility is good, hotels are good and they are safe, there is a beautiful sea beach, I thought I can take a bath but I was disappointed because no body have that permission to bath in the sea, I liked this place so much.",Pondicherry
"A beautiful spot in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. It's actually a bridge named Ram jhula on the mighty river Ganga. Ram jhula is full of fresh and beautiful nature beauty. The best place for river rafting and in the evening an awesome sight to be explored, full of temples in the other side of the bridge, beautiful market places, good for shopping. Hotel accommodations are also very preferable with streams beside the rooms. Most are located near the hills.",Ram Jhula
"Back in November, we were discussing about which place we could visit and spend sometime. We quickly googled Pondicherry and found some serene images speaking volumes about the city calmness. Also we wanted to visit a coastal area, so decided to give Pondicherry a try. Pondicherry is 6-7 hrs away from Bangalore and the roads are easy to travel. Hailed a prepaid sleeper bus and had reserved a stay in The Tamizh Park. Although looking at the pictures, we knew we were heading to a city, but the moment we reached, there was something different about this place. The city's unique architecture of French and Tamil made us fall in love with the place. This small place has alot to offer and the best way to explore the city is to hire a cycle or two wheeler. The city's architecture and the Government's efforts to keep them clean makes this city an amazing place to be in. Low levels of pollution, a rich heritage, cheap booze, good people, spirituality, libraries and French Quarters are some of its features. Beaches are clean and virgin, which is a rare site in India. Auroville is a must visit place and so is the Paradise beach, with the beautiful view of backwaters and sea on the other side. All I can say is if I could, I would settle down here : )",Pondicherry
"Dear friends, severel times I visited Pondicherry because its very nearer to my native. In this situation I would like to share my own experience about pondicherry. Pondicherry is one of the Union teritory in India. It is situated very closer to Tamilnadu. Previously it was ruled by France. Hence, lot of French people living there. 1.AUROVILE TOWN: Aurovile town is situated out side of Pondicherry. Its a township designed in a latest manners. The main thing is that place is very calm & peace. In there I found peace of mind. ARAVINDHAR ASHRAM is one of the important Religious center in Pondicherry. 2.PONDICHERRY BEACH: Pondicherry is surrounded by Bay of Bengal sea. Pondicherry Beach is big & clean. In their we played Cricket & Tennis. In the evening times chill wind gives us a good enjoyment. Lot of Hotel/accomodation in Pondicherry in a nominal cost. Hence, accomodation is not a big matter in pondicherry. In my observation Pondicherry is saftey place to stay there & settle there. No theft or no any such incidents happened there.",Pondicherry
I had been to pondicheery in themonth of february for 3days. My main attraction to visit this place was the Paradise beach and Auro beach. I did visit these two beaches plus got a chance yo visit Rock beach too. Which was just amazing. The culture we have in Pondicherry is different from the entire India. Plus I got a chance to visit Maitrmandir which again an eye opener because it was so beautiful. We got a chance to attand the yoga session in Maitrimandir which was so good and relaxing. I have hundreds of picture to share. Over all its one of the best places?,Pondicherry

Hello viewers today I am going to review on the tourist place in Rishikesh known as Ram Jhula so this is a common place you met there  2nd Jhula  is known asLaxman Jhula so there are many tourist place in Rishikesh like Bhootnath Temple near to Marine Drive Triveni Ghat and many more others so you can just go to Rishikesh to take up view on these things but ramjhula is my favourite because this is To ends From one end to another above the river Ganga so you can see fishes if the water slows down Fishes are mainly seen at winter time so you can go there to have a look so at night many of the lights effects on the Jhula and it will Glow like a glowing stick that is the best moment ever captured on my camera you can go with two wheelers on the Jhula but four wheeler can't go with so After rafting if you are standing on Ram Jhula you can see the river rafting boards going from down on river Ganga so this is also a best moment of yours if you are there at day time so this is my small review on Ram Jhula tourist place of Rishikesh so I feel like Like comment share or you can just directly inbox into my message so if you like me just follow me because you follow me and I follow trend,Ram Jhula
"Ram jhula is a iron suspension bridge on the river Ganga. Its nearest about 3 kilometers away from the Hrishikesh in the state of Uttrakhand. The most visited place in Hrishikesh. When a person will go Hrishikesh he must see the both bridges named - Ram jhola anf Lachman jhola. A views  walk from one side to another the scenes are awesome, beautiful If you will go to Hrishikesh must visit these bridges. From my personal opinion its just watchable. Hotels are available on Haridwar and Hrishikesh. There are many places you will go for sightseeing.",Ram Jhula
"Hi friends, I going to share my experience in pondicherry. When I was 14 years old I went to pondicherry with my uncle. We stayed two days in pondicherry and travelled and visited some places. First we went to restaurant and ate sea foods. Still now I remember one dish we ate. We ate fish briyani with finger fish. It is so special in pondicherry. Everybody should taste atleast once. We went to beach. We saw a gandhiji statue in pondicherry. In beach, we cannot play with sea  waves because, thete is no sand and at the sea shore it is fully covered with black rocks. We went shopping and purchase sea items. We visited vinayagar temple inthat temple there were 108 vinayagar statues. Pondicherry",Pondicherry

Happy journey",Ram Jhula
"Dear Tourists to Pondicherry, I just returned from Pondicherry, my overall experience is very bad and I will narrate the whole tour experience. PONDICHERRY UNSAFE FOR COUPLE and small Family Group vacation. We were very excited to visit Pondicherry after my husband booked three days trip from Bangalore. We planned well and drove to Pondicherry and reached around noon on 25-Mar-2018, we took Chittoor, Vellore route which is long route as many said the roads were good. The drive was not hectic only from Vellore to Tindavanam was bit of slow drive. As we had planned everything in advanced, we checked in the hotel and after fresh-up we hit the much hyped Kamatchi restaurant had sea food, the food is average nothing to say more about it. Later we drove to Rock Beach and had small walk. Later from Rock Beach we went to Aurobindo Ashram, it is good & peaceful, from here we drove to Auro Beach around 4:30pm. We all three(my daughter, wife and self) started to enter the beach to play in the water, few local guys came and started making nuisance, taking photos, so we moved away from this place and went 200 meters away and got into the water. they appeared here too and started taking photos as if they were taking some other photos. This behavior of the locals made us feel bad and the expectation became very low. We packed from here, and about to leave they followed us, luckily there were cops there, seeing them they dispersed. Then we thought of taking evening walk at the Rock beach, we came back here and spend time then we hit back to our hotel and called for the day… Next day morning we enjoyed and relaxed in hotel pool till 2pm, then we drove to Paradise Beach(there are two Paradise beaches, one near Windflower resort and the other 4 km from there), as per the Google maps we reached the windflower Paradise beach. There was not much crowd, as it was Monday. We walked for a km to reach the beach, on the way we packed few fried fished from the local stall and enjoying the  fish at the shore watching the beautiful sea. Suddenly two guys came near and started taking pictures of my daughter and wife as if they were taking selfies. I objected them, they said ok will not take, but they keep on staring and taking photos. We moved to a nearby family enjoying in the beach waters. They followed us, taking pictures… as we had bad experience the first day, we packed from there and about to leave, these two guys came and asked if we can give some pose for photos. We said no and started walking back to the car parking; they started to follow-us. To avoid any incidents, we went to fish stall and narrated them the story. They were good and told us not to worry, nothing will happen here. When we were having the fish fry, the two guys appeared inside the stall and spoke to the stall lady. The lady came and told that I told them, if they bother them we will call the police. But they handed over the phone # and asked them to call if not there will be some consequences. We were frightened; we rushed from the stall so that we can getaways from this place.  But these guys had gather about 5-6 other guys and came in front of our car couple of times and stopped. After about 200 mts, they stopped us and few guys had tied hand kerchiefs around the face, the two guys came to my car door banning the door and asking us to get down. Luckily my wife and daughter asked me to say inside and lock all the windows and doors. I immediately called police control room and narrated the story. Seeing these guys dispersed. The police control room sent two police person to the spot, it was a great relief for us. We narrated the same to these police and shared the bike no(Last 4 digit were 4353). they were helpful. We requested them to accompany us till the main road, to which they agreed. OUR SINCERE THANKS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS. On reaching hotel, we did not go out anywhere… next day we were suppose to go to Paradise boat house and Auro Villa. We cancelled our stay and returned to Bangalore. This is the worst experience of our lifetime, we have done domestic and international vacations. Each and every vacation was beautiful… This is the worst. Piece of advice to all tourists There is nothing much WOW in Pondicherry, in just one day we can cover all picnic spots. Beaware of the local goons, who are wandering in all picnic spots especially the beaches. If they see some modern girls they create problems. If who are just couples or small family, I request you to stay away from Pondicherry it is not worth it Local goons will just stare at the girls and ladies, if we question they will created problems If at all we still want to visit Pondicherry, I suggest you to visit in large groups I rate negative for Pondicherry as a vacation spot, I casually talking to other guest in the hotel, they to narrate the same stories. IF THE PONDICHEERY GOVERNMENT WANTS TO PROMOTE TOURISIM THEN THEY HAVE TO CONTROL THESE GOONS and BRING IN STRICT LAW. I Will never visit Pondicherry again.",Pondicherry

"Lucknow is good as long as you dont need to talk to the local crowd here. The tehzeeb of the city of nawabs is lost with time. People here are rude and would always look at tourists as targets that they could loot. From rickshaw pullers to shopkeepers to people on the road you talk to inorder to get directions or for any queries, do not expect any good .All in all if u plan a trip to lucknow, from personal experience I would suggest to look for other options which could be far more better than this place. Places definitely NOT TO GO if you dont want to ruin your mood on the trip - Imambada - guides and security people here will not only treat you like you are unwanted there but will also force you to pay money for unnecessary guides after you buy the entry ticket. If you say no they wont let you enter and will throw you out. Guni sunshine chikan art, aminabad - the staff here welcomes you first but when you dont like their stuff they will abuse you. Incase you buy anything and then ask for any other service their behaviour will flip as if now you are not a customer but a liability that they want out as soon as possible . Save your money and time and find much much better places to visit in India than lucknow.",Lucknow

"Hi, this is Saurabh Sharma want to share my views about Lucknow, actually I went to Lucknow trip with my family 05 years back, and we found unhygienic city due to the pathetic cleaning in the city, all the area of Lucknow was very dirty in terms of hotels, local sightseeing area, markets, railway station etc. Lucknow is the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh  and it is also called city of Nababs .we went there through the train  and it is very easy accessible and we reached the char baagh railway station first in Lucknow. and we found pathetic cleaning in Lucknow Railway station. There are lots of places for the local sightseeing, we hired a taxi for local sightseeing places like  Bada Imambara, Chota Imambara, Ambedkar Memorial Park, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Park, Zoo etc. everything was fine at there but the main thing was that we found pathetic cleaning in everywhere in lucknow which makes a unhygienic environment and which is not good for health. We had stay in the hotel name called Comfort Inn which was far 9 km from the railway station and it is situated in Vibhuti Khand an emerging bisiness centre of lucknow.I have remembered that we booked a deluxe room in this hotel and we had paid Rs 3000 per room night which was very expensive on those days and we found pathetic cleaning quality in the room and pathetic food quality in the hotel, so we faced worst experience in the hotel. According to the safety point of view, i would give my honest review in this, we had seen lots of thieves in the railway station who caught by the police so be careful specially in the railway station, you can get pocket pickers thieves .",Lucknow

The park also consist of modern fort in which the statue of great leader are placed. The city have its own foods, one of them is the Kababs, these are made up of meat and spices mixed and cooked very well which lefts a mouth watering flavour in mouth. It is served with parathas which make the taste of Kababs more tasty. One cannot just explore the whole city in one day.",Lucknow

I have recently been to ramjhula. It is a beautiful place to be. I was there early in the morning around 5 30am so that I can enjoy the view of the ramjhula from dark to the sunrise. Its so clean and peaceful to be there. Morning winds that touches your hair and face bring a new freahness to you and your mind. I only had the complain about the tempo driver there they charged me a lot as I was new there and I don't know the rates but beside that the view of the hills and the ganga river was worth every single penny I invested there. So the right time to visit the ram jhula would be around 6 am so that you can enjoy the view with a peace of mind as onluly few people would be there. Lastly tha ghat there was so clean that's how you maintain the ghat. The water of the ganga was so chilled that's gives you the feeling of the ice just melted and follown down the river. That's my riew. Ganga 5 stars Views 4 stars Local 2 stars as they charged me a lot. I recommend you to go and a have great time there.,Ram Jhula
"The Only Place in the world where Hindu's are waiting for Eid more than muslims do, and A muslim lighten his Home during diwali more than a Hindu, Besides of religion we make Lucknow, a place of peace, humanity and brotherhood. I can remember when I was young, my father tought me one thing, You can leave Lucknow at any time in your whole life, but Lucknow will never leave you, Now I got the real meaning of that sentence, why is it so hard to find a place like Lucknow, If you can relate, just be proud of that, you have been here, The famous places like chowk, nakkas, ganj where every one has visited atleast for once and have wonderful memories of the same. The place where you can eat and wear the CHICKEN. The only place( in UP) where your daughter/sister can wander at midnight. The Only Place where kababs are tundey yet delicious. The Only place Where the sound aarti from tamples and azan from masjids can make a melody song. It is never ending place of joy where you find etarnal peace in the country that have largest democracy. A lot to say about lucknow. I am proud that I born and grew up here. Thank you lucknow. The City of NAWABS",Lucknow

In other words LUCKNOW can be said luck-now means success now.",Lucknow
